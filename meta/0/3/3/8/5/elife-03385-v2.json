We have used biochemical and genetic analyses to delineate the rules for TAM receptor–ligand engagement and find that the TAMs segregate into two groups based on ligand specificity, regulation by phosphatidylserine, and function. Tyro3 and Mer are activated by both ligands but only Gas6 activates Axl. Optimal TAM signaling requires coincident TAM ligand engagement of both its receptor and the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PtdSer): Gas6 lacking its PtdSer-binding ‘Gla domain’ is significantly weakened as a Tyro3/Mer agonist and is inert as an Axl agonist, even though it binds to Axl with wild-type affinity. In two settings of TAM-dependent homeostatic phagocytosis, Mer plays a predominant role while Axl is dispensable, and activation of Mer by Protein S is sufficient to drive phagocytosis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03385"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03385"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03385","entryfile":"elife-03385-v2.xml","files":["elife-03385-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03385-v1.xml"]}
