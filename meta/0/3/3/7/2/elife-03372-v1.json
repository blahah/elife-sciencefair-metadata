The dynein regulator Lis1 is known to keep dynein bound to microtubules; however, how this is accomplished mechanistically remains unknown. We have used three-dimensional electron microscopy, single-molecule imaging, biochemistry, and in vivo assays to help establish this mechanism. The three-dimensional structure of the dynein–Lis1 complex shows that binding of Lis1 to dynein's AAA+ ring sterically prevents dynein's main mechanical element, the ‘linker’, from completing its normal conformational cycle. Single-molecule experiments show that eliminating this block by shortening the linker to a point where it can physically bypass Lis1 renders single dynein motors insensitive to regulation by Lis1. Our data reveal that Lis1 keeps dynein in a persistent microtubule-bound state by directly blocking the progression of its mechanochemical cycle.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03372"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03372"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03372","entryfile":"elife-03372-v1.xml","files":["elife-03372-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03372-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
