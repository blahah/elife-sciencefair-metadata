However, it is unclear how these processes are regulated and function. To determine these mechanisms, we characterized the folding energy and kinetics of four representative SNARE complexes at a single-molecule level using high-resolution optical tweezers. We found that all SNARE complexes assemble by the same step-wise zippering mechanism: slow N-terminal domain (NTD) association, a pause in a force-dependent half-zippered intermediate, and fast C-terminal domain (CTD) zippering. The energy release from CTD zippering differs for yeast (13 <italic>k</italic><sub>undefined</sub><italic>T</italic>) and neuronal SNARE complexes (27 <italic>k</italic><sub>undefined</sub><italic>T</italic>), and is concentrated at the C-terminal part of CTD zippering. Thus, SNARE complexes share a conserved zippering pathway and polarized energy release to efficiently drive membrane fusion, but generate different amounts of zippering energy to regulate fusion kinetics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03348"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03348"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03348","entryfile":"elife-03348-v2.xml","files":["elife-03348-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03348-v1.xml"]}
