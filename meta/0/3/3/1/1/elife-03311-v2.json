To elucidate such function(s), we generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple KO mice. Triple KO cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect. Additionally, a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis was observed, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which we confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Our results indicate that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin, in addition to other roles that include, as we show here, a low affinity interaction with SNAREs, is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03311"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03311"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03311","entryfile":"elife-03311-v2.xml","files":["elife-03311-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03311-v1.xml"]}
