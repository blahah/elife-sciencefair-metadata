{"title":"Mechanical design principles of a mitotic spindle","author":[{"surname":"Ward","given-names":"Jonathan J"},{"surname":"Roque","given-names":"Hélio"},{"surname":"Antony","given-names":"Claude"},{"surname":"Nédélec","given-names":"François"}],"abstract":"An organised spindle is crucial to the fidelity of chromosome segregation, but the relationship between spindle structure and function is not well understood in any cell type. The anaphase B spindle in fission yeast has a slender morphology and must elongate against compressive forces. This ‘pushing’ mode of chromosome transport renders the spindle susceptible to breakage, as observed in cells with a variety of defects. Here we perform electron tomographic analyses of the spindle, which suggest that it organises a limited supply of structural components to increase its compressive strength. Structural integrity is maintained throughout the spindle's fourfold elongation by organising microtubules into a rigid transverse array, preserving correct microtubule number and dynamically rescaling microtubule length.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03398"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03398"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03398","entryfile":"elife-03398-v2.xml","files":["elife-03398-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03398-v1.xml"]}
