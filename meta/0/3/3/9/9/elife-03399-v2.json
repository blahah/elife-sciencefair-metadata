The PCM expands dramatically as cells enter mitosis, but it is unclear how this occurs. In this study, we show that the centriole protein Asl initiates the recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn to mother centrioles; both proteins then assemble into co-dependent scaffold-like structures that spread outwards from the mother centriole and recruit most, if not all, other PCM components. In the absence of either DSpd-2 or Cnn, mitotic PCM assembly is diminished; in the absence of both proteins, it appears to be abolished. We show that DSpd-2 helps incorporate Cnn into the PCM and that Cnn then helps maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM, creating a positive feedback loop that promotes robust PCM expansion around the mother centriole during mitosis. These observations suggest a surprisingly simple mechanism of mitotic PCM assembly in flies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03399"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03399"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03399","entryfile":"elife-03399-v2.xml","files":["elife-03399-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03399-v1.xml"]}
