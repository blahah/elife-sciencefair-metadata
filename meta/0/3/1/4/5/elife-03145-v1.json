We use high-resolution X-ray crystallography and computational methods to delineate the mechanism of the homotrimeric RND-type proton/drug antiporter AcrB, the active component of the major efflux system AcrAB-TolC in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and one most complex and intriguing membrane transporters known to date. Analysis of wildtype AcrB and four functionally-inactive variants reveals an unprecedented mechanism that involves two remote alternating-access conformational cycles within each protomer, namely one for protons in the transmembrane region and another for drugs in the periplasmic domain, 50 Å apart. Each of these cycles entails two distinct types of collective motions of two structural repeats, coupled by flanking α-helices that project from the membrane. Moreover, we rationalize how the cross-talk among protomers across the trimerization interface might lead to a more kinetically efficient efflux system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03145"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03145"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"03145","entryfile":"elife-03145-v1.xml","files":["elife-03145-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig11-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03145-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
