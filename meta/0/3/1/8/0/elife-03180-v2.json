Despite this critical role, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation. To determine the role for CD28 after T cell priming, we generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after priming. We show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03180"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03180"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03180","entryfile":"elife-03180-v2.xml","files":["elife-03180-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03180-v1.xml"]}
