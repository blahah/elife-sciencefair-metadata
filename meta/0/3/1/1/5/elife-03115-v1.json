Despite this, little is known about the genes setting up this endodermal barrier. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a strong barrier mutant, <italic>schengen3</italic> (<italic>sgn3</italic>). We observe a surprising ability of the mutant to maintain nutrient homeostasis, but demonstrate a major defect in maintaining sufficient levels of the macronutrient potassium. We show that <italic>SGN3/GASSHO1</italic> is a receptor-like kinase that is necessary for localizing CASPARIAN STRIP DOMAIN PROTEINS (CASPs)—major players of endodermal differentiation—into an uninterrupted, ring-like domain. SGN3 appears to localize into a broader band, embedding growing CASP microdomains. The discovery of <italic>SGN3</italic> strongly advances our ability to interrogate mechanisms of plant nutrient homeostasis and provides a novel actor for localized microdomain formation at the endodermal plasma membrane.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03115"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03115"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03115","entryfile":"elife-03115-v1.xml","files":["elife-03115-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03115-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
