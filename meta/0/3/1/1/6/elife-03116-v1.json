While much is known about the molecules that control filopodia extension and subsequent maturation into functional synapses, the mechanisms that regulate initiation of these dynamic, actin-rich structures have remained elusive. Here, we find that filopodia initiation is suppressed by recruitment of ArhGAP44 to actin-patches that seed filopodia. Recruitment is mediated by binding of a membrane curvature-sensing ArhGAP44 N-BAR domain to plasma membrane sections that were deformed inward by acto-myosin mediated contractile forces. A GAP domain in ArhGAP44 triggers local Rac-GTP hydrolysis, thus reducing actin polymerization required for filopodia formation. Additionally, ArhGAP44 expression increases during neuronal development, concurrent with a decrease in the rate of filopodia formation. Together, our data reveals a local auto-regulatory mechanism that limits initiation of filopodia via protein recruitment to nanoscale membrane deformations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03116"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03116"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03116","entryfile":"elife-03116-v1.xml","files":["elife-03116-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03116-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
