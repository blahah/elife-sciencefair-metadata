No similar structure has been identified in prokaryotes. The bacteriophage-encoded tubulin PhuZ is required to position DNA at mid-cell, without which infectivity is compromised. Here, we show that PhuZ filaments, like microtubules, stochastically switch from growing in a distinctly polar manner to catastrophic depolymerization (dynamic instability) both in vitro and in vivo. One end of each PhuZ filament is stably anchored near the cell pole to form a spindle-like array that orients the growing ends toward the phage nucleoid so as to position it near mid-cell. Our results demonstrate how a bacteriophage can harness the properties of a tubulin-like cytoskeleton for efficient propagation. This represents the first identification of a prokaryotic tubulin with the dynamic instability of microtubules and the ability to form a simplified bipolar spindle.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03197"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03197"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03197","entryfile":"elife-03197-v1.xml","files":["elife-03197-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03197-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
