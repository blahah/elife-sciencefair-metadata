In this study, we demonstrate a new role for eEF1A: it participates in the entire process of the heat shock response (HSR) in mammalian cells from transcription through translation. Upon stress, isoform 1 of eEF1A rapidly activates transcription of HSP70 by recruiting the master regulator HSF1 to its promoter. eEF1A1 then associates with elongating RNA polymerase II and the 3â€²UTR of HSP70 mRNA, stabilizing it and facilitating its transport from the nucleus to active ribosomes. eEF1A1-depleted cells exhibit severely impaired HSR and compromised thermotolerance. In contrast, tissue-specific isoform 2 of eEF1A does not support HSR. By adjusting transcriptional yield to translational needs, eEF1A1 renders HSR rapid, robust, and highly selective; thus, representing an attractive therapeutic target for numerous conditions associated with disrupted protein homeostasis, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03164"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03164"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03164","entryfile":"elife-03164-v1.xml","files":["elife-03164-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03164-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
