We have identified a mouse mutant, <italic>bloto</italic>, that harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335. <italic>Zfp335</italic><sup>bloto/bloto</sup> mice exhibit a naïve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins to manifest in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335<sup>bloto</sup> are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03549"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03549"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03549","entryfile":"elife-03549-v1.xml","files":["elife-03549-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03549-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
