We show that Marf (Mitochondrial associated regulatory factor), is required for mitochondrial fusion and transport in long axons. Moreover, loss of <italic>Marf</italic> leads to a severe depletion of mitochondria in neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). <italic>Marf</italic> mutants also fail to maintain proper synaptic transmission at NMJs upon repetitive stimulation, similar to <italic>Drp1</italic> fission mutants. However, unlike <italic>Drp1</italic>, loss of <italic>Marf</italic> leads to NMJ morphology defects and extended larval lifespan. Marf is required to form contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum and/or lipid droplets (LDs) and for proper storage of cholesterol and ecdysone synthesis in ring glands. Interestingly, human Mitofusin-2 rescues the loss of LD but both Mitofusin-1 and Mitofusin-2 are required for steroid-hormone synthesis. Our data show that Marf and Mitofusins share an evolutionarily conserved role in mitochondrial transport, cholesterol ester storage and steroid-hormone synthesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03558"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03558"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03558","entryfile":"elife-03558-v2.xml","files":["elife-03558-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03558-v1.xml"]}
