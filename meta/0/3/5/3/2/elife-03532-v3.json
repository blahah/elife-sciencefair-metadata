Their translocation domain is a large β-barrel occluded by a plug domain, which is displaced to allow the translocation of pilus subunits across the membrane. Previous studies suggested that this gating mechanism is controlled by a β-hairpin and an α-helix. To investigate the role of these elements in allosteric signal communication, we developed a method combining evolutionary and molecular dynamics studies of the native translocation domain and mutants lacking the β-hairpin and/or the α-helix. Analysis of a hybrid residue interaction network suggests distinct regions (residue ‘communities’) within the translocation domain (especially around β12–β14) linking these elements, thereby modulating PapC gating. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed functional roles for four of these communities. This study illuminates the gating mechanism of PapC ushers and its importance in maintaining outer-membrane permeability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03532"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03532"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03532","entryfile":"elife-03532-v3.xml","files":["elife-03532-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03532-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03532-v1.xml","elife-03532-v2.xml"]}
