Plant guard cells, that form stomatal pores for gas exchange, provide a powerful system for in depth investigation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling specificity in plants. In intact guard cells, abscisic acid (ABA) enhances (primes) the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of downstream signaling events that result in activation of S-type anion channels during stomatal closure, providing a specificity mechanism in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. However, the underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show impairment of ABA signal transduction in stomata of calcium-dependent protein kinase quadruple mutant plants. Interestingly, protein phosphatase 2Cs prevent non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate an unexpected interdependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent ABA-signaling branches and the <italic>in planta</italic> requirement of simultaneous phosphorylation at two key phosphorylation sites in SLAC1. We identify novel mechanisms ensuring specificity and robustness within stomatal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling on a cellular, genetic, and biochemical level.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03599"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03599"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03599","entryfile":"elife-03599-v1.xml","files":["elife-03599-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig6-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03599-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
