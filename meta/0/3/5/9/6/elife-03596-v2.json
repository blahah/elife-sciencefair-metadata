In this study, we report that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mammalian Sp8 transcription factor Buttonhead (Btd) prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval type II neuroblast (NB) lineages. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. We provide evidence to demonstrate that Btd prevents the premature differentiation by suppressing the expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in immature INPs. We further show that Btd functions cooperatively with the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 to promote the generation of INPs. Thus, our work reveals a critical mechanism that prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of <italic>Drosophila</italic> INPs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03596"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03596"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03596","entryfile":"elife-03596-v2.xml","files":["elife-03596-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03596-v1.xml"]}
