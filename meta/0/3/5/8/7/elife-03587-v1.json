In this study, we show that the capsule of the synchronizable model bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> is cell cycle regulated and we unearth a bacterial transglutaminase homolog, HvyA, as restriction factor that prevents capsulation in G1-phase cells. This capsule protects cells from infection by a generalized transducing <italic>Caulobacter</italic> phage (φCr30), and the loss of HvyA confers insensitivity towards φCr30. Control of capsulation during the cell cycle could serve as a simple means to prevent steric hindrance of flagellar motility or to ensure that phage-mediated genetic exchange happens before the onset of DNA replication. Moreover, the multi-layered regulatory circuitry directing HvyA expression to G1-phase is conserved during evolution, and HvyA orthologues from related <italic>Sinorhizobia</italic> can prevent capsulation in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, indicating that alpha-proteobacteria have retained HvyA activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03587"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03587"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03587","entryfile":"elife-03587-v1.xml","files":["elife-03587-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03587-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
