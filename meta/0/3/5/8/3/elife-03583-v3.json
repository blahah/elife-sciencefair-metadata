{"title":"Structure and transport mechanism of the sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1","author":[{"surname":"Paulino","given-names":"Cristina"},{"surname":"Wöhlert","given-names":"David"},{"surname":"Kapotova","given-names":"Ekaterina"},{"surname":"Yildiz","given-names":"Özkan"},{"surname":"Kühlbrandt","given-names":"Werner"}],"abstract":"Sodium/proton antiporters are essential for sodium and pH homeostasis and play a major role in human health and disease. We determined the structures of the archaeal sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1 in two complementary states. The inward-open state was obtained by x-ray crystallography in the presence of sodium at pH 8, where the transporter is highly active. The outward-open state was obtained by electron crystallography without sodium at pH 4, where MjNhaP1 is inactive. Comparison of both structures reveals a 7° tilt of the 6 helix bundle. <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake measurements indicate non-cooperative transport with an activity maximum at pH 7.5. We conclude that binding of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion from the outside induces helix movements that close the extracellular cavity, open the cytoplasmic funnel, and result in a ∼5 Å vertical relocation of the ion binding site to release the substrate ion into the cytoplasm.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03583"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03583"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03583","entryfile":"elife-03583-v3.xml","files":["elife-03583-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig11-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig9-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03583-v1.xml","elife-03583-v2.xml"]}
