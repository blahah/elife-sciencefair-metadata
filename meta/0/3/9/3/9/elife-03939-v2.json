Kinetic competition between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA fate, yet such coupling has never been observed in vivo on single transcripts. In this study, we use dual-color single-molecule RNA imaging in living human cells to construct a complete kinetic profile of transcription and splicing of the Î²-globin gene. We find that kinetic competition results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a strict quality control checkpoint. The majority of pre-mRNAs are spliced after release, while diffusing away from the site of transcription. A single missense point mutation (S34F) in the essential splicing factor U2AF1 which occurs in human cancers perturbs this kinetic balance and defers splicing to occur entirely post-release.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03939"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03939"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"03939","entryfile":"elife-03939-v2.xml","files":["elife-03939-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03939-v1.xml"]}
