{"title":"Genetic basis of sRNA quantitative variation analyzed using an experimental population derived from an elite rice hybrid","author":[{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Jia"},{"surname":"Yao","given-names":"Wen"},{"surname":"Zhu","given-names":"Dan"},{"surname":"Xie","given-names":"Weibo"},{"surname":"Zhang","given-names":"Qifa"}],"abstract":"We performed a genetic analysis of sRNA abundance in flag leaf from an immortalized F<sub>2</sub> (IMF2) population in rice. We identified 53,613,739 unique sRNAs and 165,797 sRNA expression traits (s-traits). A total of 66,649 s-traits mapped 40,049 <italic>local</italic>-sQTLs and 30,809 <italic>distant</italic>-sQTLs. By defining 80,362 sRNA clusters, 22,263 sRNA cluster QTLs (scQTLs) were recovered for 20,249 of all the 50,139 sRNA cluster expression traits (sc-traits). The expression levels for most of s-traits from the same genes or the same sRNA clusters were slightly positively correlated. While genetic co-regulation between sRNAs from the same mother genes and between sRNAs and their mother genes was observed for a portion of the sRNAs, most of the sRNAs and their mother genes showed little co-regulation. Some sRNA biogenesis genes were located in <italic>distant</italic>-sQTL hotspots and showed correspondence with specific length classes of sRNAs suggesting their important roles in the regulation and biogenesis of the sRNAs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03913"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03913"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03913","entryfile":"elife-03913-v2.xml","files":["elife-03913-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03913-v1.xml"]}
