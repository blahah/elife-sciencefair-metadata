We report that targeted disruption of TGF-β superfamily receptor ALK7 alleviates diet-induced catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, thereby reducing obesity in mice. Global and fat-specific <italic>Alk7</italic> knock-out enhanced adipose β-AR expression, β-adrenergic signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid oxidation, and lipolysis under a high fat diet, leading to elevated energy expenditure, decreased fat mass, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Conversely, activation of ALK7 reduced β-AR-mediated signaling and lipolysis cell-autonomously in both mouse and human adipocytes. Acute inhibition of ALK7 in adult mice by a chemical-genetic approach reduced diet-induced weight gain, fat accumulation, and adipocyte size, and enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and β-adrenergic signaling. We propose that ALK7 signaling contributes to diet-induced catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, and suggest that ALK7 inhibitors may have therapeutic value in human obesity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03245"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03245"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03245","entryfile":"elife-03245-v1.xml","files":["elife-03245-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03245-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
