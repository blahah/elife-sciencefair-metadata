To dissect the chemical signals and the genes mediating this association, we investigated the effect of an oriental beetle sex pheromone on the development and behavior of the nematode <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic>. We found that while the beetle pheromone is attractive to <italic>P. pacificus</italic> adults, the pheromone arrests embryo development, paralyzes J2 larva, and inhibits exit of dauer larvae. To uncover the mechanism that regulates insect pheromone sensitivity, a newly identified mutant, <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic>, is used to reveal the molecular links between altered attraction towards the beetle pheromone, as well as hypersensitivity to its paralyzing effects. <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> encodes lipid-binding domains and reaches its highest expression in various cell types, including the amphid neuron sheath and excretory cells. Our data suggest that the beetle host pheromone may be a species-specific volatile synomone that co-evolved with necromeny.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03229"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03229"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03229","entryfile":"elife-03229-v2.xml","files":["elife-03229-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03229-v1.xml"]}
