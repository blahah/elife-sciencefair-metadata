We describe a bioinformatic approach (genome neighborhood network; GNN) that enables large scale prediction of the in vitro enzymatic activities and in vivo physiological functions (metabolic pathways) of uncharacterized enzymes in protein families. We demonstrate the utility of the GNN approach by predicting in vitro activities and in vivo functions in the proline racemase superfamily (PRS; InterPro IPR008794). The predictions were verified by measuring in vitro activities for 51 proteins in 12 families in the PRS that represent ~85% of the sequences; in vitro activities of pathway enzymes, carbon/nitrogen source phenotypes, and/or transcriptomic studies confirmed the predicted pathways. The synergistic use of sequence similarity networks<sup>3</sup> and GNNs will facilitate the discovery of the components of novel, uncharacterized metabolic pathways in sequenced genomes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03275"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03275"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03275","entryfile":"elife-03275-v2.xml","files":["elife-03275-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03275-v1.xml"]}
