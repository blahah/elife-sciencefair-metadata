How the CMG is assembled and engages DNA substrates remains unclear. Using electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of the CMG in the presence of ATPγS and a DNA duplex bearing a 3′ single-stranded tail. The structure shows that the MCM subunits of the CMG bind preferentially to single-stranded DNA, establishes the polarity by which DNA enters into the Mcm2-7 pore, and explains how Cdc45 helps prevent DNA from dissociating from the helicase. The Mcm2-7 subcomplex forms a cracked-ring, right-handed spiral when DNA and nucleotide are bound, revealing unexpected congruencies between the CMG and both bacterial DnaB helicases and the AAA+ motor of the eukaryotic proteasome. The existence of a subpopulation of dimeric CMGs establishes the subunit register of Mcm2-7 double hexamers and together with the spiral form highlights how Mcm2-7 transitions through different conformational and assembly states as it matures into a functional helicase.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03273"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03273"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03273","entryfile":"elife-03273-v2.xml","files":["elife-03273-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03273-v1.xml"]}
