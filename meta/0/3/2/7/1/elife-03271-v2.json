In the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> stomatal lineage, a transient self-renewing phase creates precursors that differentiate into one of two epidermal cell types, guard cells or pavement cells. We found that irreversible differentiation of guard cells involves RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) recruitment to regulatory regions of master regulators of stomatal initiation, facilitated through interaction with a terminal stomatal lineage transcription factor, FAMA. Disrupting physical interactions between FAMA and RBR preferentially reveals the role of RBR in enforcing fate commitment over its role in cell-cycle control in this developmental context. Analysis of the phenotypes linked to the modulation of FAMA and RBR sheds new light on the way iterative divisions and terminal differentiation are coordinately regulated in a plant stem-cell lineage.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03271"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03271"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03271","entryfile":"elife-03271-v2.xml","files":["elife-03271-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03271-v1.xml"]}
