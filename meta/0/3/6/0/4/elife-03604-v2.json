CNTs also play a crucial role in the uptake of nucleoside-derived drugs, including anticancer and antiviral agents. Understanding how CNTs recognize and import their substrates could not only lead to a better understanding of nucleoside-related biological processes but also the design of nucleoside-derived drugs that can better reach their targets. Here, we present a combination of X-ray crystallographic and equilibrium-binding studies probing the molecular origins of nucleoside and nucleoside drug selectivity of a CNT from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. We then used this information in chemically modifying an anticancer drug so that it is better transported by and selective for a single human CNT subtype. This work provides proof of principle for utilizing transporter structural and functional information for the design of compounds that enter cells more efficiently and selectively.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03604"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03604"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"07","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03604","entryfile":"elife-03604-v2.xml","files":["elife-03604-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03604-v1.xml"]}
