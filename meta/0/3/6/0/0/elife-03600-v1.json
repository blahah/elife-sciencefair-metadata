Previously we used a series of still diffraction patterns to determine the structure of lysozyme at 2.9 Å resolution with MicroED (<xref>Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Here we present the structure of bovine liver catalase determined from a single crystal at 3.2 Å resolution by MicroED. The data were collected by continuous rotation of the sample under constant exposure and were processed and refined using standard programs for X-ray crystallography. The ability of MicroED to determine the structure of bovine liver catalase, a protein that has long resisted atomic analysis by traditional electron crystallography, demonstrates the potential of this method for structure determination.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03600"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03600"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03600","entryfile":"elife-03600-v1.xml","files":["elife-03600-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03600-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03600-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03600-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
