Tissue-specific expression of accessory (β) subunits causes these channels to generate currents with distinct properties. In the heart, KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channels coassemble with KCNE1 β-subunits to generate the I<sub>Ks</sub> current (<xref>Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref>Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>), an important current for maintenance of stable heart rhythms. KCNE1 significantly modulates the gating, permeation, and pharmacology of KCNQ1 (<xref>Wrobel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref>Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref>Abbott, 2014</xref>). These changes are essential for the physiological role of I<sub>Ks</sub> (<xref>Silva and Rudy, 2005</xref>); however, after 18 years of study, no coherent mechanism explaining how KCNE1 affects KCNQ1 has emerged. Here we provide evidence of such a mechanism, whereby, KCNE1 alters the state-dependent interactions that functionally couple the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) to the pore.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03606"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03606"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03606","entryfile":"elife-03606-v1.xml","files":["elife-03606-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03606-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
