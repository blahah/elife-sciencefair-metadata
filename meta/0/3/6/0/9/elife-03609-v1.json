Here we report that small molecules, such as cyanine 3 (Cy3), a synthetic fluorescent molecule, and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP), one of the most noted haptens, are γδ T cell antigens, recognized directly by specific γδ TCRs. Immunization with Cy3 conjugates induces a rapid Cy3-specific γδ T cell IL-17 response. These results expand the role of small molecules and chemical modifications in immunity and underscore the role of γδ T cells as unique adaptive immune cells that couple B cell-like antigen recognition capability with T cell effector function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03609"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03609"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03609","entryfile":"elife-03609-v1.xml","files":["elife-03609-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03609-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03609-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03609-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03609-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
