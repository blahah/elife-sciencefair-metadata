To this end we present an approach termed PRIME for generating cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) based on molecular and phenotypic data. We build >280 models of normal and cancer cell-lines that successfully predict metabolic phenotypes in an individual manner. We utilize this set of cell-specific models to predict drug targets that selectively inhibit cancerous but not normal cell proliferation. The top predicted target, <italic>MLYCD</italic>, is experimentally validated and the metabolic effects of MLYCD depletion investigated. Furthermore, we tested cell-specific predicted responses to the inhibition of metabolic enzymes, and successfully inferred the prognosis of cancer patients based on their PRIME-derived individual GSMMs. These results lay a computational basis and a counterpart experimental proof of concept for future personalized metabolic modeling applications, enhancing the search for novel selective anticancer therapies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03641"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03641"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03641","entryfile":"elife-03641-v1.xml","files":["elife-03641-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig5-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03641-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
