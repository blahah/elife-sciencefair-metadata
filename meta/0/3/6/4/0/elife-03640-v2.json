To identify functional translational readthrough, we estimated the readthrough propensity (RTP) of all stop codon contexts of the human genome by a new regression model in silico, identified a nucleotide consensus motif for high RTP by using this model, and analyzed all readthrough extensions in silico with a new predictor for peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) showed the highest combined RTP and PTS1 probability. Experimentally we show that at least 1.6% of the total cellular LDHB is targeted to the peroxisome by a conserved hidden PTS1. The readthrough-extended lactate dehydrogenase subunit LDHBx can also co-import LDHA, the other LDH subunit, into peroxisomes. Peroxisomal LDH is conserved in mammals and likely contributes to redox equivalent regeneration in peroxisomes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03640"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03640"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03640","entryfile":"elife-03640-v2.xml","files":["elife-03640-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig10-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03640-v1.xml"]}
