Combined with a 7.5 Å resolution reconstruction of the minimal complex between LdcI and the LdcI-binding domain of RavA, and the previously solved crystal structures of the individual components, this work enables to build a reliable pseudoatomic model of this unusual architecture and to identify conformational rearrangements and specific elements essential for complex formation. The design of the cage created via lateral interactions between five RavA rings is unique for the diverse AAA+ ATPase superfamily.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03653"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03653"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03653","entryfile":"elife-03653-v2.xml","files":["elife-03653-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03653-v1.xml"]}
