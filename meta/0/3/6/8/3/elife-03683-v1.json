However, the severity of CF lung disease correlates poorly with genotype. Antibiotic treatment helps dramatically prolong patients' life. The lung disease generally determines prognosis and causes most morbidity and mortality; early control of infections is thus critical. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a main cause of early infection in CF lungs. It secretes sphingomyelinase (SMase) C that can suppress CFTR activity. SMase C also inhibits voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels in lymphocytes; inhibition of these channels causes immunosuppression. SMase C's pathogenicity is further illustrated by the demonstration that once <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> is engineered to express high levels of SMase C, the resulting mutant can evade the host immunity elicited by a live vaccine because additional pathogenic mechanisms are created. By screening a chemical library, we find that the natural product tannic acid is an SMase C antidote.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03683"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03683"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03683","entryfile":"elife-03683-v1.xml","files":["elife-03683-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03683-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03683-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03683-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
