{"title":"Pvr expression regulators in equilibrium signal control and maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood progenitors","author":[{"surname":"Mondal","given-names":"Bama Charan"},{"surname":"Shim","given-names":"Jiwon"},{"surname":"Evans","given-names":"Cory J"},{"surname":"Banerjee","given-names":"Utpal"}],"abstract":"Blood progenitors within the lymph gland, a larval organ that supports hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, are maintained by integrating signals emanating from niche-like cells and those from differentiating blood cells. We term the signal from differentiating cells the ‘equilibrium signal’ in order to distinguish it from the ‘niche signal’. Earlier we showed that equilibrium signaling utilizes Pvr (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PDGF/VEGF receptor), STAT92E, and adenosine deaminase-related growth factor A (ADGF-A) (<xref>Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). Little is known about how this signal initiates during hematopoietic development. To identify new genes involved in lymph gland blood progenitor maintenance, particularly those involved in equilibrium signaling, we performed a genetic screen that identified <italic>bip1</italic> (<italic>bric à brac interacting protein 1</italic>) and <italic>Nucleoporin 98</italic> (<italic>Nup98</italic>) as additional regulators of the equilibrium signal. We show that the products of these genes along with the Bip1-interacting protein RpS8 (Ribosomal protein S8) are required for the proper expression of Pvr.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03626"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03626"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03626","entryfile":"elife-03626-v2.xml","files":["elife-03626-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig6-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03626-v1.xml"]}
