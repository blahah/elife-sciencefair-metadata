In this study, we describe a novel function of TAFs in directing genomic occupancy of a transcriptional activator. Using liver-specific inactivation in mice, we show that the TAF4 subunit of TFIID is required for post-natal hepatocyte maturation. TAF4 promotes pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation at post-natal expressed liver function genes and down-regulates a subset of embryonic expressed genes by increased RNA polymerase II pausing. The TAF4–TAF12 heterodimer interacts directly with HNF4A and in vivo TAF4 is necessary to maintain HNF4A-directed embryonic gene expression at post-natal stages and promotes HNF4A occupancy of functional cis-regulatory elements adjacent to the transcription start sites of post-natal expressed genes. Stable HNF4A occupancy of these regulatory elements requires TAF4-dependent PIC formation highlighting that these are mutually dependent events. Local promoter-proximal HNF4A–TFIID interactions therefore act as instructive signals for post-natal hepatocyte differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03613"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03613"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03613","entryfile":"elife-03613-v2.xml","files":["elife-03613-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03613-v1.xml"]}
