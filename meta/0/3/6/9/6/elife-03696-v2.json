However, their developmental relationships remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that different MSC populations in the developing marrow of long bones have distinct functions. Proliferative mesoderm-derived nestin<sup>−</sup> MSCs participate in fetal skeletogenesis and lose MSC activity soon after birth. In contrast, quiescent neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> cells preserve MSC activity, but do not generate fetal chondrocytes. Instead, they differentiate into HSC niche-forming MSCs, helping to establish the HSC niche by secreting Cxcl12. Perineural migration of these cells to the bone marrow requires the ErbB3 receptor. The neonatal Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfrα<sup>−</sup> cell population also contains Schwann cell precursors, but does not comprise mature Schwann cells. Thus, in the developing bone marrow HSC niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and glial cells, and ontogenically distinct MSCs have non-overlapping functions in endochondrogenesis and HSC niche formation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03696"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03696"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03696","entryfile":"elife-03696-v2.xml","files":["elife-03696-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03696-v1.xml"]}
