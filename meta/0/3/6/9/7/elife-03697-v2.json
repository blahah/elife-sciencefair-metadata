{"title":"A neural circuit mechanism for regulating vocal variability during song learning in zebra finches","author":[{"surname":"Garst-Orozco","given-names":"Jonathan"},{"surname":"Babadi","given-names":"Baktash"},{"surname":"Ölveczky","given-names":"Bence P"}],"abstract":"Motor skill learning is characterized by improved performance and reduced motor variability. The neural mechanisms that couple skill level and variability, however, are not known. The zebra finch, a songbird, presents a unique opportunity to address this question because production of learned song and induction of vocal variability are instantiated in distinct circuits that converge on a motor cortex analogue controlling vocal output. To probe the interplay between learning and variability, we made intracellular recordings from neurons in this area, characterizing how their inputs from the functionally distinct pathways change throughout song development. We found that inputs that drive stereotyped song-patterns are strengthened and pruned, while inputs that induce variability remain unchanged. A simple network model showed that strengthening and pruning of action-specific connections reduces the sensitivity of motor control circuits to variable input and neural ‘noise’. This identifies a simple and general mechanism for learning-related regulation of motor variability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03697"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03697"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03697","entryfile":"elife-03697-v2.xml","files":["elife-03697-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03697-v1.xml"]}
