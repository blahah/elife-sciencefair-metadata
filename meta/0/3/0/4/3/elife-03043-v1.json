{"title":"Human premotor areas parse sequences into their spatial and temporal features","author":[{"surname":"Kornysheva","given-names":"Katja"},{"surname":"Diedrichsen","given-names":"JÃ¶rn"}],"abstract":"Skilled performance is characterized by precise and flexible control of movement sequences in space and time. Recent theories suggest that integrated spatio-temporal trajectories are generated by intrinsic dynamics of motor and premotor networks. This contrasts with behavioural advantages that emerge when a trained spatial or temporal feature of sequences is transferred to a new spatio-temporal combination arguing for independent neural representations of these sequence features. We used a new fMRI pattern classification approach to identify brain regions with independent vs integrated representations. A distinct regional dissociation within motor areas was revealed: whereas only the contralateral primary motor cortex exhibited unique patterns for each spatio-temporal sequence combination, bilateral premotor areas represented spatial and temporal features independently of each other. These findings advocate a unique function of higher motor areas for flexible recombination and efficient encoding of complex motor behaviours.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03043"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03043"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03043","entryfile":"elife-03043-v1.xml","files":["elife-03043-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03043-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
