These ‘head direction’ cells are largely confined to a closely-connected network of sites. We describe, for the first time, a population of head direction cells in nucleus reuniens of the thalamus in the freely-moving rat. This novel subcortical head direction signal potentially modulates the hippocampal CA fields directly and, thus, informs spatial processing and memory.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03075"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03075"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"07","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03075","entryfile":"elife-03075-v2.xml","files":["elife-03075-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03075-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03075-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03075-v1.xml"]}
