Inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) is a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis and crucial for maintaining cellular guanine deoxy- and ribonucleotide pools needed for DNA and RNA synthesis. It is highly expressed in many malignancies. We previously showed that inhibition of IMPDH2 leads to p53 activation by causing RS. Surprisingly, our current study reveals that Inauzhin (INZ), a novel non-genotoxic p53 activator by inhibiting SIRT1, can also inhibit cellular IMPDH2 activity, and reduce the levels of cellular GTP and GTP-binding nucleostemin that is essential for rRNA processing. Consequently, INZ induces RS and the RPL11/RPL5-MDM2 interaction, activating p53. These results support the new notion that INZ suppresses cancer cell growth by dually targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03077"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03077"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03077","entryfile":"elife-03077-v1.xml","files":["elife-03077-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03077-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03077-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03077-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03077-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03077-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03077-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
