{"title":"Protein kinase C is a calcium sensor for presynaptic short-term plasticity","author":[{"surname":"Fioravante","given-names":"Diasynou"},{"surname":"Chu","given-names":"YunXiang"},{"surname":"de Jong","given-names":"Arthur PH"},{"surname":"Leitges","given-names":"Michael"},{"surname":"Kaeser","given-names":"Pascal S"},{"surname":"Regehr","given-names":"Wade G"}],"abstract":"In presynaptic boutons, calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) triggers both neurotransmitter release and short-term synaptic plasticity. Whereas synaptotagmins are known to mediate vesicle fusion through binding of high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> to their C2 domains, the proteins that sense smaller global Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases to produce short-term plasticity have remained elusive. Here, we identify a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of plasticity thought to underlie short-term memory. We find that at the functionally mature calyx of Held synapse the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase C isoforms α and β are necessary for PTP, and the expression of PKCβ in PKCαβ double knockout mice rescues PTP. Disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKCβ C2 domain specifically prevents PTP without impairing other PKCβ-dependent forms of synaptic enhancement. We conclude that different C2-domain-containing presynaptic proteins are engaged by different Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases evoked by tetanic stimulation are sensed by PKCβ to produce PTP.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03011"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03011"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03011","entryfile":"elife-03011-v1.xml","files":["elife-03011-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03011-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
