The emergence of parasite resistance to front-line drugs has prompted a renewed focus on the repositioning of clinically approved drugs as potential anti-malarial therapies. Antibiotics that inhibit protein translation are promising candidates for repositioning. We have solved the cryo-EM structure of the cytoplasmic ribosome from the human malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, in complex with emetine at 3.2 Ã… resolution. Emetine is an anti-protozoan drug used in the treatment of ameobiasis that also displays potent anti-malarial activity. Emetine interacts with the E-site of the ribosomal small subunit and shares a similar binding site with the antibiotic pactamycin, thereby delivering its therapeutic effect by blocking mRNA/tRNA translocation. As the first cryo-EM structure that visualizes an antibiotic bound to any ribosome at atomic resolution, this establishes cryo-EM as a powerful tool for screening and guiding the design of drugs that target parasite translation machinery.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03080"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03080"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"03080","entryfile":"elife-03080-v2.xml","files":["elife-03080-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03080-v1.xml"]}
