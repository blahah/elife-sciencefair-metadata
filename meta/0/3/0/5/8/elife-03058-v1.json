Phenotypes arising from deletion of an entire genomic locus cannot be unequivocally attributed either to the loss of the lncRNA per se or to the associated loss of other overlapping DNA regulatory elements. The distinction between <italic>cis</italic>- or <italic>trans</italic>-effects is also often problematic. We discuss the advantages and challenges associated with the current techniques for studying the in vivo function of lncRNAs in the light of different models of lncRNA molecular mechanism, and reflect on the design of experiments to mutate lncRNA loci. These considerations should assist in the further investigation of these transcriptional products of the genome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03058"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03058"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03058","entryfile":"elife-03058-v1.xml","files":["elife-03058-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03058-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03058-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
