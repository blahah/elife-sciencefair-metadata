The universally conserved YidC protein mediates this process either individually as a membrane protein insertase, or in concert with the SecY complex. Here, we present a structural model of YidC based on evolutionary co-variation analysis, lipid-versus-protein-exposure and molecular dynamics simulations. The model suggests a distinctive arrangement of the conserved five transmembrane domains and a helical hairpin between transmembrane segment 2 (TM2) and TM3 on the cytoplasmic membrane surface. The model was used for docking into a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a translating YidC-ribosome complex carrying the YidC substrate F<sub>O</sub>c. This structure reveals how a single copy of YidC interacts with the ribosome at the ribosomal tunnel exit and identifies a site for membrane protein insertion at the YidC protein-lipid interface. Together, these data suggest a mechanism for the co-translational mode of YidC-mediated membrane protein insertion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03035"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03035"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"07","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03035","entryfile":"elife-03035-v2.xml","files":["elife-03035-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03035-v1.xml"]}
