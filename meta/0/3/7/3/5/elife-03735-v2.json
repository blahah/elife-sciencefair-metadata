The significance of unequal codon usage remains unclear. One hypothesis is that frequent codons are translated relatively rapidly. However, there is little direct, in vivo, evidence regarding codon-specific translation rates. In this study, we generate high-coverage data using ribosome profiling in yeast, analyze using a novel algorithm, and deduce events at the A- and P-sites of the ribosome. Different codons are decoded at different rates in the A-site. In general, frequent codons are decoded more quickly than rare codons, and AT-rich codons are decoded more quickly than GC-rich codons. At the P-site, proline is slow in forming peptide bonds. We also apply our algorithm to short footprints from a different conformation of the ribosome and find strong amino acid-specific (not codon-specific) effects that may reflect interactions with the exit tunnel of the ribosome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03735"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03735"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03735","entryfile":"elife-03735-v2.xml","files":["elife-03735-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03735-v1.xml"]}
