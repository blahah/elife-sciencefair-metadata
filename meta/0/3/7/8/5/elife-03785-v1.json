The evolutionary mechanism driving the adaptation of a species to a toxic host is, however, intriguing. We analyzed the tight association of <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> to its sole host, the fruit of <italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic>, which is toxic to other members of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> species group. Molecular polymorphisms in the dopamine regulatory protein Catsup cause infertility in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> due to maternal arrest of oogenesis. In its natural host, the fruit compensates for the impaired maternal dopamine metabolism with the precursor <sc>l</sc>-DOPA, resuming oogenesis and stimulating egg production. <sc>l</sc>-DOPA present in morinda additionally increases the size of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> eggs, what in turn enhances early fitness. We argue that the need of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA for successful reproduction has driven <italic>D. sechellia</italic> to become an <italic>M. citrifolia</italic> obligate specialist. This study illustrates how an insect's dopaminergic system can sustain ecological adaptations by modulating ontogenesis and development.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03785"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03785"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03785","entryfile":"elife-03785-v1.xml","files":["elife-03785-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03785-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
