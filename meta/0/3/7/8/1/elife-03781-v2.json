In this study, we show that mice lacking the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R KO mice) manifest greatly reduced FAA, whereas mice lacking the dopamine D2 receptor have normal FAA. To determine where dopamine exerts its effect, we limited expression of dopamine signaling to the dorsal striatum of dopamine-deficient mice; these mice developed FAA. Within the dorsal striatum, the daily rhythm of clock gene <italic>period2</italic> expression was markedly suppressed in D1R KO mice. Pharmacological activation of D1R at the same time daily was sufficient to establish anticipatory activity in wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that dopamine signaling to D1R-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum plays an important role in manifestation of FAA, possibly by synchronizing circadian oscillators that modulate motivational processes and behavioral output.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03781"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03781"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03781","entryfile":"elife-03781-v2.xml","files":["elife-03781-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig12-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03781-v1.xml"]}
