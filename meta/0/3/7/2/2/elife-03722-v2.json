In the periphery, a transmission bottleneck constrains performance; thus efficient coding implies that natural signal components with a predictably wider range should be compressed. In a different regime—when sampling limitations constrain performance—efficient coding implies that <italic>more</italic> resources should be allocated to informative features that are more variable. We propose that this regime is relevant for sensory cortex when it extracts complex features from limited numbers of sensory samples. To test this prediction, we use central visual processing as a model: we show that visual sensitivity for local multi-point spatial correlations, described by dozens of independently-measured parameters, can be quantitatively predicted from the structure of natural images. This suggests that efficient coding applies centrally, where it extends to higher-order sensory features and operates in a regime in which sensitivity increases with feature variability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03722"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03722"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03722","entryfile":"elife-03722-v2.xml","files":["elife-03722-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03722-v1.xml"]}
