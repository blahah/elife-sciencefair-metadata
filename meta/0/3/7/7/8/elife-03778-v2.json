Overexpression of NEDD4L can also stimulate HIV-1 release but in this case the Gag protein lacks a PPXY motif, suggesting that NEDD4L may function through an adaptor protein. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular protein Angiomotin (AMOT) can bind both NEDD4L and HIV-1 Gag. HIV-1 release and infectivity are stimulated by AMOT overexpression and inhibited by AMOT depletion, whereas AMOT mutants that cannot bind NEDD4L cannot function in virus release. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that in the absence of AMOT assembling Gag molecules fail to form a fully spherical enveloped particle. Our experiments indicate that AMOT and other motin family members function together with NEDD4L to help complete immature virion assembly prior to ESCRT-mediated virus budding.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03778"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03778"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03778","entryfile":"elife-03778-v2.xml","files":["elife-03778-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03778-v1.xml"]}
