While it has been described that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation becomes defective in old age, the cellular mechanism is largely unknown. Autophagy is a major cellular lysosomal degradation pathway of bulk material, and levels are known to fall with age. In this study, we describe a novel role for autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation. Mice lacking the autophagy gene <italic>Atg7</italic> in T cells failed to establish CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory to influenza and MCMV infection. Interestingly, autophagy levels were diminished in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from aged mice. We could rejuvenate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in elderly mice in an autophagy dependent manner using the compound spermidine. This study reveals a cell intrinsic explanation for poor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory in the elderly and potentially offers novel immune modulators to improve aged immunity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03706"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03706"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03706","entryfile":"elife-03706-v1.xml","files":["elife-03706-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03706-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
