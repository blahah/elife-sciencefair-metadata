Multiple sites of alternative splicing within a single gene exponentially increase the number of possible spliced isoforms, with most human genes currently estimated to express at least ten. To understand the mechanisms underlying these complex isoform expression patterns, methods are needed that faithfully maintain long-range exon connectivity information in individual RNA molecules. In this study, we describe SeqZip, a methodology that uses RNA-templated DNA–DNA ligation to retain and compress connectivity between distant sequences within single RNA molecules. Using this assay, we test proposed coordination between distant sites of alternative exon utilization in mouse <italic>Fn1</italic>, and we characterize the extraordinary exon diversity of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster Dscam1</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03700"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03700"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03700","entryfile":"elife-03700-v2.xml","files":["elife-03700-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03700-v1.xml"]}
