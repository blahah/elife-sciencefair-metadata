Here we demonstrate that TibC from ETEC harbors a heptosyltransferase activity on TibA and AIDA-I, defining a large family of bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferases (BAHTs). The crystal structure of TibC reveals a characteristic ring-shape dodecamer. The protomer features an N-terminal β-barrel, a catalytic domain, a β-hairpin thumb, and a unique iron-finger motif. The iron-finger motif contributes to back-to-back dimerization; six dimers form the ring through β-hairpin thumb-mediated hand-in-hand contact. The structure of ADP-D-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose (ADP-D,D-heptose)-bound TibC reveals a sugar transfer mechanism and also the ligand stereoselectivity determinant. Electron-cryomicroscopy analyses uncover a TibC–TibA dodecamer/hexamer assembly with two enzyme molecules binding to one TibA substrate. The complex structure also highlights a high efficient hyperglycosylation of six autotransporter substrates simultaneously by the dodecamer enzyme complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03714"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03714"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03714","entryfile":"elife-03714-v2.xml","files":["elife-03714-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03714-v1.xml"]}
