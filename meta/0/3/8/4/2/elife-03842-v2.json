In this study, we investigate the uncharacterized gene <italic>Flattop (Fltp)</italic> that is transcriptionally activated during PCP acquisition in ciliated tissues. <italic>Fltp</italic> knock-out mice show BB docking and ciliogenesis defects in multiciliated lung cells. Furthermore, Fltp is necessary for kinocilium positioning in monociliated inner ear hair cells. In these cells, the core PCP molecule Dishevelled 2, the BB/spindle positioning protein Dlg3, and Fltp localize directly adjacent to the apical plasma membrane, physically interact and surround the BB at the interface of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. Dlg3 and Fltp knock-outs suggest that both cooperatively translate PCP cues for BB positioning in the inner ear. Taken together, the identification of novel BB/spindle positioning components as potential mediators of PCP signaling might have broader implications for other cell types, ciliary disease, and asymmetric cell division.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03842"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03842"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03842","entryfile":"elife-03842-v2.xml","files":["elife-03842-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03842-v1.xml"]}
