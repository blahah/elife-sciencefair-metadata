{"title":"Spontaneous symbiotic reprogramming of plant roots triggered by receptor-like kinases","author":[{"surname":"Ried","given-names":"Martina Katharina"},{"surname":"Antol√≠n-Llovera","given-names":"Meritxell"},{"surname":"Parniske","given-names":"Martin"}],"abstract":"Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK) is indispensable for the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) as well as nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis, but the mechanisms that discriminate between the two distinct symbiotic developmental fates have been enigmatic. In this study, we show that upon ectopic expression, the receptor-like kinase genes <italic>Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1)</italic>, <italic>NFR5,</italic> and <italic>SYMRK</italic> initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Furthermore, overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 associated with endogenous SYMRK in roots of the legume <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>. Epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active <italic>SYMRK</italic> allele initiates signalling independently of either the <italic>NFR1</italic> or <italic>NFR5</italic> gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. Only <italic>SYMRK</italic> but not <italic>NFR</italic> overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03891"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03891"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03891","entryfile":"elife-03891-v1.xml","files":["elife-03891-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03891-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
