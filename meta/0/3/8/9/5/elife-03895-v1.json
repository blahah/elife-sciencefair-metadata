In this study, we report that the CIDE-N protein Drep-2 is a novel synaptic protein important for learning and behavioral adaptation. Drep-2 was found at synapses throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain and was strongly enriched at mushroom body input synapses. It was required within Kenyon cells for normal olfactory short- and intermediate-term memory. Drep-2 colocalized with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Chronic pharmacological stimulation of mGluRs compensated for <italic>drep-2</italic> learning deficits, and <italic>drep-2</italic> and <italic>mGluR</italic> learning phenotypes behaved non-additively, suggesting that Drep 2 might be involved in effective mGluR signaling. In fact, <italic>Drosophila</italic> fragile X protein mutants, shown to benefit from attenuation of mGluR signaling, profited from the elimination of <italic>drep-2</italic>. Thus, Drep-2 is a novel regulatory synaptic factor, probably intersecting with metabotropic signaling and translational regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03895"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03895"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03895","entryfile":"elife-03895-v1.xml","files":["elife-03895-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03895-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
