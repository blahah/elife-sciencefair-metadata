{"title":"RUNX1, a transcription factor mutated in breast cancer, controls the fate of ER-positive mammary luminal cells","author":[{"surname":"van Bragt","given-names":"Maaike PA"},{"surname":"Hu","given-names":"Xin"},{"surname":"Xie","given-names":"Ying"},{"surname":"Li","given-names":"Zhe"}],"abstract":"<italic>RUNX1</italic> encodes a RUNX family transcription factor (TF) and was recently identified as a novel mutated gene in human luminal breast cancers. We found that <italic>Runx1</italic> is expressed in all subpopulations of murine mammary epithelial cells (MECs) except the secretory alveolar luminal cells. Conditional knockout of <italic>Runx1</italic> in MECs by <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic> led to a decrease in luminal MECs, largely due to a profound reduction in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive mature luminal subpopulation, a phenotype that could be rescued by the loss of either <italic>Trp53</italic> or <italic>Rb1</italic>. Mechanistically RUNX1 represses <italic>Elf5</italic>, a master regulatory TF gene for alveolar cells, and regulates mature luminal TF/co-factor genes (e.g., <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Cited1</italic>) involved in the ER program. Collectively, our data identified a key regulator of the ER<sup>+</sup> luminal lineage whose disruption may contribute to the development of ER<sup>+</sup> luminal breast cancer when under the background of either <italic>TP53</italic> or <italic>RB1</italic> loss.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03881"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03881"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03881","entryfile":"elife-03881-v2.xml","files":["elife-03881-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03881-v1.xml"]}
