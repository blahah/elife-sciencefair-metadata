With the aim of identifying individuals in whom ART might induce a period of viraemic control on stopping therapy, we hypothesised that quantification of the pool of latently infected cells in primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) would predict clinical progression and viral replication following ART. We measured HIV-1 DNA in a highly characterised randomised population of individuals with PHI. We explored associations between HIV-1 DNA and immunological and virological markers of clinical progression, including viral rebound in those interrupting therapy. In multivariable analyses, HIV-1 DNA was more predictive of disease progression than plasma viral load and, at treatment interruption, predicted time to plasma virus rebound. HIV-1 DNA may help identify individuals who could safely interrupt ART in future HIV-1 eradication trials.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03821"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03821"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03821","entryfile":"elife-03821-v2.xml","files":["elife-03821-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03821-v1.xml"]}
