Using CD4<sup>+</sup> autoimmune Teff cells, we demonstrate that peptide immunotherapy (PIT) is strictly dependent upon sustained T cell expression of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-1. We found high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at the PD-1 (<italic>Pdcd1</italic>) promoter of non-tolerant T cells. 5hmC was lost in response to PIT, with DNA hypomethylation of the promoter. We identified dynamic changes in expression of the genes encoding the Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins that are associated with the oxidative conversion 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC, during cytosine demethylation. We describe a model whereby promoter demethylation requires the co-incident expression of permissive histone modifications at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter together with TET availability. This combination was only seen in tolerant Teff cells following PIT, but not in Teff that transiently express PD-1. Epigenetic changes at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> locus therefore determine the tolerizing potential of TCR-ligation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03416"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03416"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03416","entryfile":"elife-03416-v2.xml","files":["elife-03416-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03416-v1.xml"]}
