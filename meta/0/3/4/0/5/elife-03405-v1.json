Using <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon calcium imaging in the rat barrel cortex during artificial whisking against different surface coarseness or controlled passive whisker vibrations simulating different coarseness, we show that layer 2–3 neurons within barrel boundaries differentially respond to specific texture coarsenesses, while only a minority of neurons responded monotonically with increased or decreased surface coarseness. Neurons with similar preferred texture coarseness were spatially clustered. Multi-contact single unit recordings showed a vertical columnar organization of texture coarseness preference in layer 2–3. These findings indicate that layer 2–3 neurons perform high hierarchical processing of tactile information, with surface coarseness embodied by distinct neuronal subpopulations that are spatially mapped onto the barrel cortex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03405"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03405"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03405","entryfile":"elife-03405-v1.xml","files":["elife-03405-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03405-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
