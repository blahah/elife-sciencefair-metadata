{"title":"Myosin VIII associates with microtubule ends and together with actin plays a role in guiding plant cell division","author":[{"surname":"Wu","given-names":"Shu-Zon"},{"surname":"Bezanilla","given-names":"Magdalena"}],"abstract":"Plant cells divide using the phragmoplast, a microtubule-based structure that directs vesicles secretion to the nascent cell plate. The phragmoplast forms at the cell center and expands to reach a specified site at the cell periphery, tens or hundreds of microns distant. The mechanism responsible for guiding the phragmoplast remains largely unknown. Here, using both moss and tobacco, we show that myosin VIII associates with the ends of phragmoplast microtubules and together with actin plays a role in guiding phragmoplast expansion to the cortical division site. Our data lead to a model whereby myosin VIII links phragmoplast microtubules to the cortical division site via actin filaments. Myosin VIII's motor activity along actin provides a molecular mechanism for steering phragmoplast expansion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03498"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03498"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03498","entryfile":"elife-03498-v1.xml","files":["elife-03498-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03498-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
