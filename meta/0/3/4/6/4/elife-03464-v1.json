The inactivating mouse <italic>Sharpin cpdm</italic> mutation causes TNF-dependent multi-organ inflammation, characterized by dermatitis, liver inflammation, splenomegaly, and loss of Peyer's patches. TNF-dependent cell death has been proposed to cause the inflammatory phenotype and consistent with this we show <italic>Tnfr1</italic>, but not <italic>Tnfr2,</italic> deficiency suppresses the phenotype (and it does so more efficiently than <italic>Il1r1</italic> loss). TNFR1-induced apoptosis can proceed through caspase-8 and BID, but reduction in or loss of these players generally did not suppress inflammation, although <italic>Casp8</italic> heterozygosity significantly delayed dermatitis. <italic>Ripk3</italic> or <italic>Mlkl</italic> deficiency partially ameliorated the multi-organ phenotype, and combined <italic>Ripk3</italic> deletion and <italic>Casp8</italic> heterozygosity almost completely suppressed it, even restoring Peyer's patches. Unexpectedly, <italic>Sharpin</italic>, <italic>Ripk3</italic> and <italic>Casp8</italic> triple deficiency caused perinatal lethality. These results provide unexpected insights into the developmental importance of SHARPIN.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03464"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03464"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03464","entryfile":"elife-03464-v1.xml","files":["elife-03464-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03464-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
