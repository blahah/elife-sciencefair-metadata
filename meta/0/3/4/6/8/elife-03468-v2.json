{"title":"T cell-specific inhibition of multiple apoptotic pathways blocks negative selection and causes autoimmunity","author":[{"surname":"Burger","given-names":"Megan L"},{"surname":"Leung","given-names":"Kenneth K"},{"surname":"Bennett","given-names":"Margaux J"},{"surname":"Winoto","given-names":"Astar"}],"abstract":"T cell self-tolerance is thought to involve peripheral tolerance and negative selection, involving apoptosis of autoreactive thymocytes. However, evidence supporting an essential role for negative selection is limited. Loss of Bim, a Bcl-2 BH3-only protein essential for thymocyte apoptosis, rarely results in autoimmunity on the C57BL/6 background. Mice with T cell-specific over-expression of Bcl-2, that blocks multiple BH3-only proteins, are also largely normal. The nuclear receptor Nur77, also implicated in negative selection, might function redundantly to promote apoptosis by associating with Bcl-2 and exposing its potentially pro-apoptotic BH3 domain. Here, we report that T cell-specific expression of a <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgene results in enhanced rescue of thymocytes from negative selection. Concomitantly, T<sub>reg</sub> development is increased. However, aged BH3 mutant mice progressively accumulate activated, autoreactive T cells, culminating in development of multi-organ autoimmunity and lethality. These data provide strong evidence that negative selection is crucial for establishing T cell tolerance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03468"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03468"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03468","entryfile":"elife-03468-v2.xml","files":["elife-03468-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03468-v1.xml"]}
