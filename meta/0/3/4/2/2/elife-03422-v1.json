Mice lacking Sharpin, a critical subunit of LUBAC, spontaneously develop inflammatory lesions in the skin and other organs. Here we show that TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain (TRADD)-dependent TNFR1 signaling in epidermal keratinocytes drives skin inflammation in Sharpin-deficient mice. Epidermis-restricted  ablation of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) combined with receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) deficiency fully prevented skin inflammation, while single RIPK3 deficiency only delayed and partly ameliorated lesion development in Sharpin-deficient mice, showing that inflammation is primarily driven by TRADD- and FADD-dependent keratinocyte apoptosis while necroptosis plays a minor role. At the cellular level, Sharpin deficiency sensitized primary murine keratinocytes, human keratinocytes, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts to TNF-induced apoptosis. Depletion of FADD or TRADD in Sharpin-deficient HaCaT cells suppressed TNF-induced apoptosis, indicating the importance of FADD and TRADD in Sharpin-dependent anti-apoptosis signaling in keratinocytes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03422"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03422"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03422","entryfile":"elife-03422-v1.xml","files":["elife-03422-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03422-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
