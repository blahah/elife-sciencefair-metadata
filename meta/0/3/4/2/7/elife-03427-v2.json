Breathing-related interneurons of the brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) that putatively comprise the core respiratory rhythm generator in mammals are derived from <italic>Dbx1</italic>-expressing precursors. Here, we show that selective photonic destruction of Dbx1 preBötC neurons in neonatal mouse slices impairs respiratory rhythm but surprisingly also the magnitude of motor output; respiratory hypoglossal nerve discharge decreased and its frequency steadily diminished until rhythm stopped irreversibly after 85±20 (mean ± SEM) cellular ablations, which corresponds to ∼15% of the estimated population. These results demonstrate that a single canonical interneuron class generates respiratory rhythm and contributes in a premotor capacity, whereas these functions are normally attributed to discrete populations. We also establish quantitative cellular parameters that govern network viability, which may have ramifications for respiratory pathology in disease states.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03427"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03427"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"07","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03427","entryfile":"elife-03427-v2.xml","files":["elife-03427-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03427-v1.xml"]}
