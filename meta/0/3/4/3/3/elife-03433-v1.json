{"title":"Analysis of the crystal structure of an active MCM hexamer","author":[{"surname":"Miller","given-names":"Justin M"},{"surname":"Arachea","given-names":"Buenafe T"},{"surname":"Epling","given-names":"Leslie B"},{"surname":"Enemark","given-names":"Eric J"}],"abstract":"In a previous Research article (<xref>Froelich et al., 2014</xref>), we suggested an MCM helicase activation mechanism, but were limited in discussing the ATPase domain because it was absent from the crystal structure. Here we present the crystal structure of a nearly full-length MCM hexamer that is helicase-active and thus has all features essential for unwinding DNA. The structure is a chimera of <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> N-terminal domain and <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ATPase domain. We discuss three major findings: 1) a novel conformation for the A-subdomain that could play a role in MCM regulation; 2) interaction of a universally conserved glutamine in the N-terminal Allosteric Communication Loop with the AAA+ domain helix-2-insert (h2i); and 3) a recessed binding pocket for the MCM ssDNA-binding motif influenced by the h2i. We suggest that during helicase activation, the h2i clamps down on the leading strand to facilitate strand retention and regulate ATP hydrolysis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03433"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03433"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03433","entryfile":"elife-03433-v1.xml","files":["elife-03433-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03433-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03433-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03433-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03433-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-03433-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
