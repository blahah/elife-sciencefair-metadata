After import, it is unclear how these intrinsically unstable and aggregation-prone proteins are targeted to the ribosome assembly site in the nucleolus. Here, we report the discovery of a conserved nuclear carrier Tsr2 that coordinates transfer of the r-protein eS26 to the earliest assembling pre-ribosome, the 90S. In vitro studies revealed that Tsr2 efficiently dissociates importin:eS26 complexes via an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism that terminates the import process. Subsequently, Tsr2 binds the released eS26, shields it from proteolysis, and ensures its safe delivery to the 90S pre-ribosome. We anticipate similar carriers—termed here escortins—to securely connect the nuclear import machinery with pathways that deposit r-proteins onto developing pre-ribosomal particles.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03473"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03473"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03473","entryfile":"elife-03473-v3.xml","files":["elife-03473-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig4-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-resp-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-03473-v1.xml","elife-03473-v2.xml"]}
