Clinically active investigational FLT3 inhibitors can achieve complete remissions but their utility has been hampered by acquired resistance and myelosuppression attributed to a ‘synthetic lethal toxicity’ arising from simultaneous inhibition of FLT3 and KIT. We report a novel chemical strategy for selective FLT3 inhibition while avoiding KIT inhibition with the staurosporine analog, Star 27. Star 27 maintains potency against FLT3 in proliferation assays of FLT3-transformed cells compared with KIT-transformed cells, shows no toxicity towards normal human hematopoiesis at concentrations that inhibit primary FLT3-mutant AML blast growth, and is active against mutations that confer resistance to clinical inhibitors. As a more complete understanding of kinase networks emerges, it may be possible to define anti-targets such as KIT in the case of AML to allow improved kinase inhibitor design of clinical agents with enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"03445"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.03445"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"03445","entryfile":"elife-03445-v2.xml","files":["elife-03445-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03445-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03445-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03445-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03445-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03445-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-03445-v1.xml"]}
