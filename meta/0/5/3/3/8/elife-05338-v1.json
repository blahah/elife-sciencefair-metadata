They allowed us to create a library of 400 GFP-tagged genes. We show that 72% of internally tagged proteins are functional, and that more than 90% can be imaged in unfixed tissues. Moreover, the tagged mRNAs can be knocked down by RNAi against GFP (iGFPi), and the tagged proteins can be efficiently knocked down by deGradFP technology. The phenotypes associated with RNA and protein knockdown typically correspond to severe loss of function or null mutant phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate reversible, spatial, and temporal knockdown of tagged proteins in larvae and adult flies. This new strategy and collection of strains allows unprecedented in vivo manipulations in flies for many genes. These strategies will likely extend to vertebrates.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05338"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05338"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05338","entryfile":"elife-05338-v1.xml","files":["elife-05338-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05338-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
