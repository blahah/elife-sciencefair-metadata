However, only a few lysine deacetylases (KDACs) have been identified in prokaryotes, perhaps in part due to their limited sequence homology. Herein, we developed a ‘clip-chip’ strategy to enable unbiased, activity-based discovery of novel KDACs in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> proteome. In-depth biochemical characterization confirmed that YcgC is a serine hydrolase involving Ser200 as the catalytic nucleophile for lysine deacetylation and does not use NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> like other established KDACs. Further, in vivo characterization demonstrated that YcgC regulates transcription by catalyzing deacetylation of Lys52 and Lys62 of a transcriptional repressor RutR. Importantly, YcgC targets a distinct set of substrates from the only known <italic>E. coli</italic> KDAC CobB. Analysis of YcgC’s bacterial homologs confirmed that they also exhibit KDAC activity. YcgC thus represents a novel family of prokaryotic KDACs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05322"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05322"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05322","entryfile":"elife-05322-v2.xml","files":["elife-05322-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05322-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05322-v1.xml"]}
