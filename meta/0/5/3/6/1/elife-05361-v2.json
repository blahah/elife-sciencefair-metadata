{"title":"Reciprocal and dynamic polarization of planar cell polarity core components and myosin","author":[{"surname":"Newman-Smith","given-names":"Erin"},{"surname":"Kourakis","given-names":"Matthew J"},{"surname":"Reeves","given-names":"Wendy"},{"surname":"Veeman","given-names":"Michael"},{"surname":"Smith","given-names":"William C"}],"abstract":"The <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord displays planar cell polarity (PCP), with anterior localization of Prickle (Pk) and Strabismus (Stbm). We report that a myosin is polarized anteriorly in these cells and strongly colocalizes with Stbm. Disruption of the actin/myosin machinery with cytochalasin or blebbistatin disrupts polarization of Pk and Stbm, but not of myosin complexes, suggesting a PCP-independent aspect of myosin localization. Wash out of cytochalasin restored Pk polarization, but not if done in the presence of blebbistatin, suggesting an active role for myosin in core PCP protein localization. On the other hand, in the <italic>pk</italic> mutant line, <italic>aimless</italic>, myosin polarization is disrupted in approximately one third of the cells, indicating a reciprocal action of core PCP signaling on myosin localization. Our results indicate a complex relationship between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and core PCP components in which myosin is not simply a downstream target of PCP signaling, but also required for PCP protein localization.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05361"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05361"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05361","entryfile":"elife-05361-v2.xml","files":["elife-05361-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05361-v1.xml"]}
