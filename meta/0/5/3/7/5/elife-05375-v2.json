{"title":"Recognition of the small regulatory RNA RydC by the bacterial Hfq protein","author":[{"surname":"Dimastrogiovanni","given-names":"Daniela"},{"surname":"Fröhlich","given-names":"Kathrin S"},{"surname":"Bandyra","given-names":"Katarzyna J"},{"surname":"Bruce","given-names":"Heather A"},{"surname":"Hohensee","given-names":"Susann"},{"surname":"Vogel","given-names":"Jörg"},{"surname":"Luisi","given-names":"Ben F"}],"abstract":"Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are key elements of regulatory networks that modulate gene expression. The sRNA RydC of <italic>Salmonella sp</italic>. and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is an example of this class of riboregulators. Like many other sRNAs, RydC bears a ‘seed’ region that recognises specific transcripts through base-pairing, and its activities are facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq. The crystal structure of RydC in complex with <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq at a 3.48 Å resolution illuminates how the protein interacts with and presents the sRNA for target recognition. Consolidating the protein–RNA complex is a host of distributed interactions mediated by the natively unstructured termini of Hfq. Based on the structure and other data, we propose a model for a dynamic effector complex comprising Hfq, small RNA, and the cognate mRNA target.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05375"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05375"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05375","entryfile":"elife-05375-v2.xml","files":["elife-05375-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-resp-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05375-v1.xml"]}
