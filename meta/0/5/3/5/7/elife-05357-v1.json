The branched character of their respiratory chains allows bacteria to do so by providing a great metabolic and regulatory flexibility. Here, we show that the native localization of the nitrate reductase, a major respiratory complex under anaerobiosis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, is submitted to tight spatiotemporal regulation in response to metabolic conditions via a mechanism using the transmembrane proton gradient as a cue for polar localization. These dynamics are critical for controlling the activity of nitrate reductase, as the formation of polar assemblies potentiates the electron flux through the complex. Thus, dynamic subcellular localization emerges as a critical factor in the control of respiration in bacteria.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05357"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05357"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05357","entryfile":"elife-05357-v1.xml","files":["elife-05357-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05357-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
