We defined disease as due to recent infection if the network-determined source was within 5 years, and assessed transmissibility from forward transmissions resulting in disease. High-quality sequences were available for 1687 disease episodes (72% of all culture-positive episodes): 66% of patients linked to at least one other patient. The between-patient mutation rate was 0.26 SNPs/year (95% CI 0.21–0.31). We showed striking differences by lineage in the proportion of disease due to recent transmission and in transmissibility (highest for lineage-2 and lowest for lineage-1) that were not confounded by immigration, HIV status or drug resistance. Transmissions resulting in disease decreased markedly over time.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05166"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05166"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05166","entryfile":"elife-05166-v1.xml","files":["elife-05166-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05166-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05166-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05166-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05166-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05166-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05166-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05166-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
