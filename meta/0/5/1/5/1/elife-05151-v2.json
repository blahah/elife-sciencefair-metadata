The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia (BG) scaffold. Specific <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05151"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05151"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05151","entryfile":"elife-05151-v2.xml","files":["elife-05151-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05151-v1.xml"]}
