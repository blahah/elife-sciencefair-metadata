{"title":"Synaptotagmin 1 directs repetitive release by coupling vesicle exocytosis to the Rab3 cycle","author":[{"surname":"Cheng","given-names":"Yunsheng"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Jiaming"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Yu"},{"surname":"Ding","given-names":"Mei"}],"abstract":"In response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, a synapse needs to release neurotransmitters quickly while immediately preparing for repeat firing. How this harmonization is achieved is not known. In this study, we found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin 1 orchestrates the membrane association/disassociation cycle of Rab3, which functions in activity-dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, synaptotagmin 1 binds to Rab3 GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits the GTP hydrolysis of Rab3 protein. Rab3 GAP resides on synaptic vesicles, and synaptotagmin 1 is essential for the synaptic localization of Rab3 GAP. In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, synaptotagmin 1 releases Rab3 GAP and promotes membrane disassociation of Rab3. Without synaptotagmin 1, the tight coupling between vesicle exocytosis and Rab3 membrane disassociation is disrupted. We uncovered the long-sought molecular apparatus linking vesicle exocytosis to Rab3 cycling and we also revealed the important function of synaptotagmin 1 in repetitive synaptic vesicle release.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05118"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05118"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05118","entryfile":"elife-05118-v2.xml","files":["elife-05118-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05118-v1.xml"]}
