The structure of the ATG14-containing PI3KC3-C1 was determined by single-particle EM, revealing a V-shaped architecture. All of the ordered domains of VPS34, VPS15, and BECN1 were mapped by MBP tagging. The dynamics of the complex were defined using hydrogenâ€“deuterium exchange, revealing a novel 20-residue ordered region C-terminal to the VPS34 C2 domain. VPS15 organizes the complex and serves as a bridge between VPS34 and the ATG14:BECN1 subcomplex. Dynamic transitions occur in which the lipid kinase domain is ejected from the complex and VPS15 pivots at the base of the V. The N-terminus of BECN1, the target for signaling inputs, resides near the pivot point. These observations provide a framework for understanding the allosteric regulation of lipid kinase activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05115"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05115"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"05115","entryfile":"elife-05115-v2.xml","files":["elife-05115-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05115-v1.xml"]}
