Mutations in <italic>leopard</italic> (<italic>leo</italic>), encoding Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A new dominant allele, <italic>leo</italic><sup>undefined</sup>, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. In a genetic screen, we identified this component as Cx39.4 (<italic>luchs</italic>). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that <italic>luchs</italic> is required for stripe formation in zebrafish; however, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras, which show that <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luchs</italic> are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggest that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and those cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05125"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05125"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05125","entryfile":"elife-05125-v2.xml","files":["elife-05125-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05125-v1.xml"]}
