Here, we show that the cellular defects caused by dysregulated Dscam levels can be ameliorated by genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Abelson kinase (Abl) both in Dscam-overexpressing neurons and in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of fragile X syndrome. This study offers Abl as a potential therapeutic target for treating brain disorders associated with dysregulated Dscam expression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05196"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05196"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05196","entryfile":"elife-05196-v1.xml","files":["elife-05196-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05196-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
