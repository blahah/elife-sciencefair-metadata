When it recodes mRNAs, it gives organisms the option to express diverse, functionally distinct, protein isoforms. All eumetazoans, from cnidarians to humans, express RNA editing enzymes. However, transcriptome-wide screens have only uncovered about 25 transcripts harboring conserved recoding RNA editing sites in mammals and several hundred recoding sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These studies on few established models have led to the general assumption that recoding by RNA editing is extremely rare. Here we employ a novel bioinformatic approach with extensive validation to show that the squid <italic>Doryteuthis pealeii</italic> recodes proteins by RNA editing to an unprecedented extent. We identify 57,108 recoding sites in the nervous system, affecting the majority of the proteins studied. Recoding is tissue-dependent, and enriched in genes with neuronal and cytoskeletal functions, suggesting it plays an important role in brain physiology.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05198"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05198"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05198","entryfile":"elife-05198-v2.xml","files":["elife-05198-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05198-v1.xml"]}
