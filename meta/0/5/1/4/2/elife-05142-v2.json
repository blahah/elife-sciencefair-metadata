{"title":"The biological function of an insect antifreeze protein simulated by molecular dynamics","author":[{"surname":"Kuiper","given-names":"Michael J"},{"surname":"Morton","given-names":"Craig J"},{"surname":"Abraham","given-names":"Sneha E"},{"surname":"Gray-Weale","given-names":"Angus"}],"abstract":"Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) protect certain cold-adapted organisms from freezing to death by selectively adsorbing to internal ice crystals and inhibiting ice propagation. The molecular details of AFP adsorption-inhibition is uncertain but is proposed to involve the Gibbs–Thomson effect. Here we show by using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations a protein structure-function mechanism for the spruce budworm <italic>Choristoneura fumiferana</italic> AFP, including stereo-specific binding and consequential melting and freezing inhibition. The protein binds indirectly to the prism ice face through a linear array of ordered water molecules that are structurally distinct from the ice. Mutation of the ice binding surface disrupts water-ordering and abolishes activity. The adsorption is virtually irreversible, and we confirm the ice growth inhibition is consistent with the Gibbs–Thomson law.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05142"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05142"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05142","entryfile":"elife-05142-v2.xml","files":["elife-05142-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05142-v1.xml"]}
