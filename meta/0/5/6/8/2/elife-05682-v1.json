Traditionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via homomeric acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) was considered to be the leading cause of ischemic acidotoxicity. Here we show that extracellular protons trigger a novel form of neuronal necroptosis via ASIC1a, but independent of its ion-conducting function. We identified serine/threonine kinase receptor interaction protein 1 (RIP1) as a critical component of this form of neuronal necroptosis. Acid stimulation recruits RIP1 to the ASIC1a C-terminus, causing RIP1 phosphorylation and subsequent neuronal death. In a mouse model of focal ischemia, middle cerebral artery occlusion causes ASIC1a-RIP1 association and RIP1 phosphorylation in affected brain areas. Deletion of the <italic>Asic1a</italic> gene significantly prevents RIP1 phosphorylation and brain damage, suggesting ASIC1a-mediated RIP1 activation has an important role in ischemic neuronal injury. Our findings indicate that extracellular protons function as a novel endogenous ligand that triggers neuronal necroptosis during ischemia via ASIC1a independent of its channel function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05682"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05682"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05682","entryfile":"elife-05682-v1.xml","files":["elife-05682-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05682-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
