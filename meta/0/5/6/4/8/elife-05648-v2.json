Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Our systems-level analyses identified a duration code that instructs stimulus specific crosstalk between TLR4-activated canonical NF-κB pathway and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) induced non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Indeed, LTβR costimulation synergistically enhanced the late RelA/NF-κB response to TLR4 prolonging NF-κB target gene-expressions. Concomitant LTβR signal targeted TLR4-induced newly synthesized p100, encoded by <italic>Nfkb2</italic>, for processing into p52 that not only neutralized p100 mediated inhibitions, but potently generated RelA:p52/NF-κB activity in a positive feedback loop. Finally, <italic>Nfkb2</italic> connected lymphotoxin signal within the intestinal niche in reinforcing epithelial innate inflammatory RelA/NF-κB response to <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection, while <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mice succumbed to gut infections owing to stromal defects. In sum, our results suggest that signal integration via the pleiotropic NF-κB system enables tissue microenvironment derived cues in calibrating physiological responses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05648"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05648"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05648","entryfile":"elife-05648-v2.xml","files":["elife-05648-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-app1-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-app1-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-app1-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-app1-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05648-v1.xml"]}
