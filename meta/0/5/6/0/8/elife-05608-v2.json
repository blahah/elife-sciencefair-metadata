Yet the mechanisms that coordinate this simultaneous opening during every heartbeat are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic, reciprocal, allosteric interactions. This ‘functional coupling’ facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by increasing activation of adjoined channels and occurs through C-terminal-to-C-terminal interactions. These interactions are initiated by binding of incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and proceed through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 pre-IQ domain. Coupling fades as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases, but persists longer than the current that evoked it, providing evidence for ‘molecular memory’. Our findings suggest a model for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx amplification that unifies diverse observations about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the heart, and challenges the long-held view that voltage-gated channels open and close independently.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05608"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05608"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05608","entryfile":"elife-05608-v2.xml","files":["elife-05608-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05608-v1.xml"]}
