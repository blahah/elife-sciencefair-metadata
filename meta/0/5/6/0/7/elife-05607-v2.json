A >30-fold variation in hepatic TG accumulation was observed among the strains. Genome-wide association studies revealed three loci associated with hepatic TG accumulation. Utilizing transcriptomic data from the liver and adipose tissue, we identified several high-confidence candidate genes for hepatic steatosis, including <italic>Gde1</italic>, a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase not previously implicated in triglyceride metabolism. We confirmed the role of <italic>Gde1</italic> by in vivo hepatic over-expression and shRNA knockdown studies. We hypothesize that <italic>Gde1</italic> expression increases TG production by contributing to the production of glycerol-3-phosphate. Our multi-level data, including transcript levels, metabolite levels, and gut microbiota composition, provide a framework for understanding genetic and environmental interactions underlying hepatic steatosis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05607"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05607"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05607","entryfile":"elife-05607-v2.xml","files":["elife-05607-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05607-v1.xml"]}
