{"title":"Advancing biology through a deeper understanding of zebrafish ecology and evolution","author":[{"surname":"Parichy","given-names":"David M"}],"abstract":"Over the last two decades, the zebrafish has joined the ranks of premier model organisms for biomedical research, with a full suite of tools and genomic resources. Yet we still know comparatively little about its natural history. Here I review what is known about the natural history of the zebrafish, where significant gaps in our knowledge remain, and how a fuller appreciation of this organism's ecology and behavior, population genetics, and phylogeny can inform a variety of research endeavors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05635"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05635"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05635","entryfile":"elife-05635-v1.xml","files":["elife-05635-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05635-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05635-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
