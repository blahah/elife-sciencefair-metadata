Brood care, a remarkable behavior promoting the survival of the next generation, has evolved independently numerous times among animals including insects. However, fossil evidence of such a complex behavior is exceptionally scarce. Here, we report an ensign scale insect (Hemiptera: Ortheziidae), <italic>Wathondara kotejai</italic> gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, which preserves eggs within a wax ovisac, and several freshly hatched nymphs. The new fossil is the only Mesozoic record of an adult female scale insect. More importantly, our finding represents the earliest unequivocal direct evidence of brood care in the insect fossil record and demonstrates a remarkably conserved egg-brooding reproductive strategy within scale insects in stasis for nearly 100 million years.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05447"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05447"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05447","entryfile":"elife-05447-v1.xml","files":["elife-05447-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05447-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05447-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05447-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
