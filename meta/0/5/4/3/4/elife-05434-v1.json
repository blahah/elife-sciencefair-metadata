IRE1 also has an endoribonuclease activity, which initiates a non-conventional mRNA splicing reaction, while PERK phosphorylates eIF2α. We engineered a potent small molecule, IPA, that binds to IRE1's ATP-binding pocket and predisposes the kinase domain to oligomerization, activating its RNase. IPA also inhibits PERK but, paradoxically, activates it at low concentrations, resulting in a bell-shaped activation profile. We reconstituted IPA-activation of PERK-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation from purified components. We estimate that under conditions of maximal activation less than 15% of PERK molecules in the reaction are occupied by IPA. We propose that IPA binding biases the PERK kinase towards its active conformation, which <italic>trans</italic>-activates apo-PERK molecules. The mechanism by which partial occupancy with an inhibitor can activate kinases may be wide-spread and carries major implications for design and therapeutic application of kinase inhibitors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05434"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05434"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05434","entryfile":"elife-05434-v1.xml","files":["elife-05434-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig16-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig17-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig18-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig19-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig20-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig21-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig22-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05434-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
