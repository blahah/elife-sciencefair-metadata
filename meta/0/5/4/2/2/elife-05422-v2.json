{"title":"A genuine layer 4 in motor cortex with prototypical synaptic circuit connectivity","author":[{"surname":"Yamawaki","given-names":"Naoki"},{"surname":"Borges","given-names":"Katharine"},{"surname":"Suter","given-names":"Benjamin A"},{"surname":"Harris","given-names":"Kenneth D"},{"surname":"Shepherd","given-names":"Gordon M G"}],"abstract":"The motor cortex (M1) is classically considered an agranular area, lacking a distinct layer 4 (L4). Here, we tested the idea that M1, despite lacking a cytoarchitecturally visible L4, nevertheless possesses its equivalent in the form of excitatory neurons with inputâ€“output circuits like those of the L4 neurons in sensory areas. Consistent with this idea, we found that neurons located in a thin laminar zone at the L3/5A border in the forelimb area of mouse M1 have multiple L4-like synaptic connections: excitatory input from thalamus, largely unidirectional excitatory outputs to L2/3 pyramidal neurons, and relatively weak long-range corticocortical inputs and outputs. M1-L4 neurons were electrophysiologically diverse but morphologically uniform, with pyramidal-type dendritic arbors and locally ramifying axons, including branches extending into L2/3. Our findings therefore identify pyramidal neurons in M1 with the expected prototypical circuit properties of excitatory L4 neurons, and question the traditional assumption that motor cortex lacks this layer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05422"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05422"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05422","entryfile":"elife-05422-v2.xml","files":["elife-05422-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05422-v1.xml"]}
