Although cell surface cues play a major role in this process, few dendrite specific signals have been identified to date. We conducted an in vivo RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons and identified the conserved Ret receptor, known to play a role in axon guidance, as an important regulator of dendrite development. The loss of <italic>Ret</italic> results in severe dendrite defects due to loss of extracellular matrix adhesion, thus impairing growth within a 2D plane. We provide evidence that <italic>Ret</italic> interacts with integrins to regulate dendrite adhesion via <italic>rac1</italic>. In addition, Ret is required for dendrite stability and normal F-actin distribution suggesting it has an essential role in dendrite maintenance. We propose novel functions for Ret as a regulator in dendrite patterning and adhesion distinct from its role in axon guidance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05491"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05491"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05491","entryfile":"elife-05491-v2.xml","files":["elife-05491-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05491-v1.xml"]}
