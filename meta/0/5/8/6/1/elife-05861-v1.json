{"title":"Genetic, evolutionary and plant breeding insights from the domestication of maize","author":[{"surname":"Hake","given-names":"Sarah"},{"surname":"Ross-Ibarra","given-names":"Jeffrey"}],"abstract":"The natural history of maize began nine thousand years ago when Mexican farmers started to collect the seeds of the wild grass, teosinte. Invaluable as a food source, maize permeated Mexican culture and religion. Its domestication eventually led to its adoption as a model organism, aided in large part by its large chromosomes, ease of pollination and growing agricultural importance. Genome comparisons between varieties of maize, teosinte and other grasses are beginning to identify the genes responsible for the domestication of modern maize and are also providing ideas for the breeding of more hardy varieties.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05861"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05861"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"05861","entryfile":"elife-05861-v1.xml","files":["elife-05861-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05861-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05861-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
