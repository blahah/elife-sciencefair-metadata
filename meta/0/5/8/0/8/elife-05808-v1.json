In addition, we generated CaRuby-Nano dextran conjugates and an AM-ester variant for bulk loading of tissue. We tested the new indicator using in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrating the high sensitivity of CaRuby-Nano as well as its power in dual color imaging experiments.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05808"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05808"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05808","entryfile":"elife-05808-v1.xml","files":["elife-05808-app1-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05808-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
