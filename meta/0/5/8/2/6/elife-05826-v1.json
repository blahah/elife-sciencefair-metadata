{"title":"The unexhausted potential of <italic>E. coli</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Blount","given-names":"Zachary D"}],"abstract":"<italic>E. coli</italic>'s hardiness, versatility, broad palate and ease of handling have made it the most intensively studied and best understood organism on the planet. However, research on <italic>E.coli</italic> has primarily examined it as a model organism, one that is abstracted from any natural history. But <italic>E. coli</italic> is far more than just a microbial lab rat. Rather, it is a highly diverse organism with a complex, multi-faceted niche in the wild. Recent studies of ‘wild’ <italic>E. coli</italic> have, for example, revealed a great deal about its presence in the environment, its diversity and genomic evolution, as well as its role in the human microbiome and disease. These findings have shed light on aspects of its biology and ecology that pose far-reaching questions and illustrate how an appreciation of <italic>E. coli</italic>'s natural history can expand its value as a model organism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05826"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05826"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05826","entryfile":"elife-05826-v1.xml","files":["elife-05826-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
