Using the cellulolytic fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> as a model, we identified a xylodextrin transport and consumption pathway required for its growth on hemicellulose. Reconstitution of this xylodextrin utilization pathway in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> revealed that fungal xylose reductases act as xylodextrin reductases, producing xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as metabolic intermediates. These xylosyl-xylitol intermediates are generated by diverse fungi and bacteria, indicating that xylodextrin reduction is widespread in nature. Xylodextrins and xylosyl-xylitol oligomers are then hydrolyzed by two hydrolases to generate intracellular xylose and xylitol. Xylodextrin consumption using a xylodextrin transporter, xylodextrin reductases and tandem intracellular hydrolases in cofermentations with sucrose and glucose greatly expands the capacity of yeast to use plant cell wall-derived sugars and has the potential to increase the efficiency of both first-generation and next-generation biofuel production.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05896"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05896"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05896","entryfile":"elife-05896-v2.xml","files":["elife-05896-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig1-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05896-v1.xml"]}
