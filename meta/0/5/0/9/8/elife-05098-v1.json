Here, we report the step-wise differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (embryonic and induced) into lung organoids. By manipulating developmental signaling pathways hPSCs generate ventral-anterior foregut spheroids, which are then expanded into human lung organoids (HLOs). HLOs consist of epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the lung, organized with structural features similar to the native lung. HLOs possess upper airway-like epithelium with basal cells and immature ciliated cells surrounded by smooth muscle and myofibroblasts as well as an alveolar-like domain with appropriate cell types. Using RNA-sequencing, we show that HLOs are remarkably similar to human fetal lung based on global transcriptional profiles, suggesting that HLOs are an excellent model to study human lung development, maturation and disease.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05098"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05098"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05098","entryfile":"elife-05098-v1.xml","files":["elife-05098-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05098-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
