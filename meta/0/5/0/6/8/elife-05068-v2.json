To test the effects of aneuploidy on chromosome segregation and other mitotic phenotypes we used the colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 (2n = 46) and two variants with trisomy 7 or 13 (DLD1+7 and DLD1+13), as well as euploid and trisomy 13 amniocytes (AF and AF+13). We found that trisomic cells displayed higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation compared to their euploid counterparts. Furthermore, cells with trisomy 13 displayed a distinctive cytokinesis failure phenotype. We showed that up-regulation of SPG20 expression, brought about by trisomy 13 in DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells, is sufficient for the cytokinesis failure phenotype. Overall, our study shows that aneuploidy can induce chromosome mis-segregation. Moreover, we identified a trisomy 13-specific mitotic phenotype that is driven by up-regulation of a gene encoded on the aneuploid chromosome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05068"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05068"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"05068","entryfile":"elife-05068-v2.xml","files":["elife-05068-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05068-v1.xml"]}
