Here we show that Rab26 is specifically associated with clusters of synaptic vesicles in neurites. Overexpression of active but not of GDP-preferring Rab26 enhances vesicle clustering, which is particularly conspicuous for the EGFP-tagged variant, resulting in a massive accumulation of synaptic vesicles in neuronal somata without altering the distribution of other organelles. Both endogenous and induced clusters co-localize with autophagy-related proteins such as Atg16L1, LC3B and Rab33B but not with other organelles. Furthermore, Atg16L1 appears to be a direct effector of Rab26 and binds Rab26 in its GTP-bound form, albeit only with low affinity. We propose that Rab26 selectively directs synaptic and secretory vesicles into preautophagosomal structures, suggesting the presence of a novel pathway for degradation of synaptic vesicles.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05597"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05597"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05597","entryfile":"elife-05597-v2.xml","files":["elife-05597-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05597-v1.xml"]}
