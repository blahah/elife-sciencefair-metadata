From reaction rate theory, we predict that a class of modulations exists, which utilize linear modulation of the energy barrier for fusion to achieve supralinear effects on the fusion rate. To test this prediction experimentally, we developed a method to assess the number of releasable vesicles, rate constants for vesicle priming, unpriming, and fusion, and the activation energy for fusion by fitting a vesicle state model to synaptic responses induced by hypertonic solutions. We show that complexinI/II deficiency or phorbol ester stimulation indeed affects responses to hypertonic solution in a supralinear manner. An additive vs multiplicative relationship between activation energy and fusion rate provides a novel explanation for previously observed non-linear effects of genetic/pharmacological perturbations on synaptic transmission and a novel interpretation of the cooperative nature of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05531"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05531"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05531","entryfile":"elife-05531-v2.xml","files":["elife-05531-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05531-v1.xml"]}
