Here we show that mRNAs encoding iterated lysine codons, AAA or AAG, differentially impact protein synthesis: insertion of iterated AAA codons into an ORF diminishes protein expression more than insertion of synonymous AAG codons. Kinetic studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> reveal that differential protein production results from pausing on consecutive AAA-lysines followed by ribosome sliding on homopolymeric A sequence. Translation in a cell-free expression system demonstrates that diminished output from AAA-codon-containing reporters results from premature translation termination on out of frame stop codons following ribosome sliding. In eukaryotes, these premature termination events target the mRNAs for Nonsense-Mediated-Decay (NMD). The finding that ribosomes slide on homopolymeric A sequences explains bioinformatic analyses indicating that consecutive AAA codons are under-represented in gene-coding sequences. Ribosome ‘sliding’ represents an unexpected type of ribosome movement possible during translation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05534"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05534"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05534","entryfile":"elife-05534-v2.xml","files":["elife-05534-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05534-v1.xml"]}
