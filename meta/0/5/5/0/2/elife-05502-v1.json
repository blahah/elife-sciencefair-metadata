However, its evolutionary origin has remained elusive. Outside the insects Toll is not known for a patterning function, but rather for a role in pathogen defense. Here, we show that in the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>, whose lineage split from <italic>Drosophila's</italic> more than 350 million years ago, Toll is only required to polarize a dynamic BMP signaling network. A theoretical model reveals that this network has self-regulatory properties and that shallow Toll signaling gradients are sufficient to initiate axis formation. Such gradients can account for the experimentally observed twinning of insect embryos upon egg fragmentation and might have evolved from a state of uniform Toll activity associated with protecting insect eggs against pathogens.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05502"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05502"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05502","entryfile":"elife-05502-v1.xml","files":["elife-05502-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05502-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
