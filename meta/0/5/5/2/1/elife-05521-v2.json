{"title":"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells regulate the regeneration of their niche by secreting Angiopoietin-1","author":[{"surname":"Zhou","given-names":"Bo O"},{"surname":"Ding","given-names":"Lei"},{"surname":"Morrison","given-names":"Sean J"}],"abstract":"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained by a perivascular niche in bone marrow but it is unclear whether the niche is reciprocally regulated by HSCs. Here, we systematically assessed the expression and function of <italic>Angiopoietin-1</italic> (<italic>Angpt1</italic>) in bone marrow. <italic>Angpt1</italic> was not expressed by osteoblasts. <italic>Angpt1</italic> was most highly expressed by HSCs, and at lower levels by c-kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors, megakaryocytes, and Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells. Global conditional deletion of <italic>Angpt1</italic>, or deletion from osteoblasts, LepR<sup>undefined</sup> cells, <italic>Nes-cre</italic>-expressing cells, megakaryocytes, endothelial cells or hematopoietic cells in normal mice did not affect hematopoiesis, HSC maintenance, or HSC quiescence. Deletion of <italic>Angpt1</italic> from hematopoietic cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> cells had little effect on vasculature or HSC frequency under steady-state conditions but accelerated vascular and hematopoietic recovery after irradiation while increasing vascular leakiness. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells regulate niche regeneration by secreting Angpt1, reducing vascular leakiness but slowing niche recovery.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05521"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05521"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05521","entryfile":"elife-05521-v2.xml","files":["elife-05521-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05521-v1.xml"]}
