Migrating cells typically form filopodia that extend from the cell surface, but the precise function of these structures in cell polarization and guided migration is poorly understood. Using the in vivo model of zebrafish primordial germ cells for studying chemokine-directed single cell migration, we show that filopodia distribution and their dynamics are dictated by the gradient of the chemokine Cxcl12a. By specifically interfering with filopodia formation, we demonstrate for the first time that these protrusions play an important role in cell polarization by Cxcl12a, as manifested by elevation of intracellular pH and Rac1 activity at the cell front. The establishment of this polarity is at the basis of effective cell migration towards the target. Together, we show that filopodia allow the interpretation of the chemotactic gradient in vivo by directing single-cell polarization in response to the guidance cue.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05279"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05279"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05279","entryfile":"elife-05279-v1.xml","files":["elife-05279-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05279-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
