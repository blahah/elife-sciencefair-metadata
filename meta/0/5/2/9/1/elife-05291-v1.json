In previous work, we observed that mast cells (MC) mediate vascular leakage during DENV infection in mice and that levels of MC activation are correlated with disease severity in human DENV patients (<xref>St John et al., 2013b</xref>). A major risk factor for developing severe dengue is secondary infection with a heterologous serotype. The dominant theory explaining increased severity during secondary DENV infection is that cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies promote uptake of virus and allow enhanced replication. Here, we define another mechanism, dependent on FcγR-mediated enhanced degranulation responses by MCs. Antibody-dependent mast cell activation constitutes a novel mechanism to explain enhanced vascular leakage during secondary DENV infection.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05291"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05291"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05291","entryfile":"elife-05291-v1.xml","files":["elife-05291-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05291-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05291-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05291-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05291-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05291-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
