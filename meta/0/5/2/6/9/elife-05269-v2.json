Bub1 and BubR1, SAC components, originated from duplication of an ancestor gene. Subsequent sub-functionalization established subordination: Bub1, recruited first to kinetochores, promotes successive BubR1 recruitment. Because both Bub1 and BubR1 hetero-dimerize with Bub3, a targeting adaptor for phosphorylated kinetochores, the molecular basis for such sub-functionalization is unclear. We demonstrate that Bub1, but not BubR1, enhances binding of Bub3 to phosphorylated kinetochores. Grafting a short motif of Bub1 onto BubR1 promotes Bub1-independent kinetochore recruitment of BubR1. This gain-of-function BubR1 mutant cannot sustain a functional checkpoint. We demonstrate that kinetochore localization of BubR1 relies on direct hetero-dimerization with Bub1 at a pseudo-symmetric interface. This pseudo-symmetric interaction underpins a template–copy relationship crucial for kinetochore–microtubule attachment and SAC signaling. Our results illustrate how gene duplication and sub-functionalization shape the workings of an essential molecular network.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05269"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05269"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05269","entryfile":"elife-05269-v2.xml","files":["elife-05269-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05269-v1.xml"]}
