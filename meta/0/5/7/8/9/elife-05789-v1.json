We use computational modelling to test different scenarios for how Four-jointed might act and test the model predictions by employing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching as an in vivo assay to measure the influence of Four-jointed on Fat-Dachsous binding. We demonstrate that in vivo, Four-jointed acts both on Fat to promote its binding to Dachsous and on Dachsous to inhibit its binding to Fat, with a bias towards a stronger effect on Fat. Overall, we show that opposing gradients of Fat and Dachsous phosphorylation are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of Fatâ€“Dachsous binding and planar polarisation across the wing, and thus demonstrate the mechanism by which a long-range gradient is interpreted.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05789"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05789"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05789","entryfile":"elife-05789-v1.xml","files":["elife-05789-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05789-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
