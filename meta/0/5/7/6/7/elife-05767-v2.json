Free or bound to ligands, polyubiquitins are found in different arrangements of ubiquitin subunits. To understand the structural basis for polyubiquitin quaternary plasticity and to explore the target recognition mechanism, we characterize the conformational space of Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>). Refining against inter-subunit paramagnetic NMR data, we show that free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists as a dynamic ensemble comprising multiple closed and open quaternary states. The quaternary dynamics enables K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> to be specifically recognized in a variety of signaling pathways. When binding to a target protein, one of the preexisting quaternary states is selected and stabilized. A point mutation that shifts the equilibrium between the different states modulates the binding affinities towards K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> ligands. This conformational selection mechanism at the quaternary level may be used by polyubiquitins of different lengths and linkages for target recognition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05767"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05767"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05767","entryfile":"elife-05767-v2.xml","files":["elife-05767-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05767-v1.xml"]}
