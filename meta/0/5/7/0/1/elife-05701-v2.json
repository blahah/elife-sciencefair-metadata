For example, damage-associated molecular patterns activate an inflammatory cascade that leads to removal of cellular debris and promotion of healing. We demonstrate that lysis of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> cells triggers a program in the remaining population that confers fitness in interspecies co-culture. We find that this program, termed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> response to antagonism (PARA), involves rapid deployment of antibacterial factors and is mediated by the Gac/Rsm global regulatory pathway. Type VI secretion, and, unexpectedly, conjugative type IV secretion within competing bacteria, induce <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lysis and activate PARA, thus providing a mechanism for the enhanced capacity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to target bacteria that elaborate these factors. Our finding that bacteria sense damaged kin and respond via a widely distributed pathway to mount a complex response raises the possibility that danger sensing is an evolutionarily conserved process.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05701"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05701"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05701","entryfile":"elife-05701-v2.xml","files":["elife-05701-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05701-v1.xml"]}
