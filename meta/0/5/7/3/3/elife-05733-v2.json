Although RNA interference (RNAi) is known to mediate antiviral immunity in plant and animal models, the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in rice and other economically important crops is poorly understood. Here, we report that rice resistance to evolutionarily diverse viruses requires Argonaute18 (AGO18). Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi. Expression of miR168-resistant <italic>AGO1a</italic> in <italic>ago18</italic> background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice. Our findings uncover a novel cooperative antiviral activity of two distinct AGO proteins and suggest a new strategy for the control of viral diseases in rice.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05733"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05733"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05733","entryfile":"elife-05733-v2.xml","files":["elife-05733-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05733-v1.xml"]}
