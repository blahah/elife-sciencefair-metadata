{"title":"Self-recognition drives the preferential accumulation of promiscuous CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in aged mice","author":[{"surname":"Deshpande","given-names":"Neha R"},{"surname":"Parrish","given-names":"Heather L"},{"surname":"Kuhns","given-names":"Michael S"}],"abstract":"T-cell recognition of self and foreign peptide antigens presented in major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHC) is essential for life-long immunity. How the ability of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment to bind self- and foreign-pMHC changes over the lifespan remains a fundamental aspect of T-cell biology that is largely unexplored. We report that, while old mice (18–22 months) contain fewer CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells compared with adults (8–12 weeks), those that remain have a higher intrinsic affinity for self-pMHC, as measured by CD5 expression. Old mice also have more cells that bind individual or multiple distinct foreign-pMHCs, and the fold increase in pMHC-binding populations is directly related to their CD5 levels. These data demonstrate that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment preferentially accumulates promiscuous constituents with age as a consequence of higher affinity T-cell receptor interactions with self-pMHC.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05949"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05949"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05949","entryfile":"elife-05949-v1.xml","files":["elife-05949-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05949-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
