These compounds have also been found in marine fish, where their accumulation is thought to be of dietary or symbiont origin. In this study, we report the unexpected discovery that fish can synthesize gadusol de novo and that the analogous pathways are also present in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that engineered yeast containing the fish genes can produce and secrete gadusol. The discovery of the gadusol pathway in vertebrates provides a platform for understanding its role in these animals, and the possibility of engineering yeast to efficiently produce a natural sunscreen and antioxidant presents an avenue for its large-scale production for possible use in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05919"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05919"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05919","entryfile":"elife-05919-v1.xml","files":["elife-05919-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05919-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
