{"title":"Insights into mammalian biology from the wild house mouse <italic>Mus musculus</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Phifer-Rixey","given-names":"Megan"},{"surname":"Nachman","given-names":"Michael W"}],"abstract":"The house mouse, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, was established in the early 1900s as one of the first genetic model organisms owing to its short generation time, comparatively large litters, ease of husbandry, and visible phenotypic variants. For these reasons and because they are mammals, house mice are well suited to serve as models for human phenotypes and disease. House mice in the wild consist of at least three distinct subspecies and harbor extensive genetic and phenotypic variation both within and between these subspecies. Wild mice have been used to study a wide range of biological processes, including immunity, cancer, male sterility, adaptive evolution, and non-Mendelian inheritance. Despite the extensive variation that exists among wild mice, classical laboratory strains are derived from a limited set of founders and thus contain only a small subset of this variation. Continued efforts to study wild house mice and to create new inbred strains from wild populations have the potential to strengthen house mice as a model system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05959"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05959"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05959","entryfile":"elife-05959-v1.xml","files":["elife-05959-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-05959-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
