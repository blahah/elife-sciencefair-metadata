{"title":"Probable nature of higher-dimensional symmetries underlying mammalian grid-cell activity patterns","author":[{"surname":"Mathis","given-names":"Alexander"},{"surname":"Stemmler","given-names":"Martin B"},{"surname":"Herz","given-names":"Andreas VM"}],"abstract":"Lattices abound in natureâ€”from the crystal structure of minerals to the honey-comb organization of ommatidia in the compound eye of insects. These arrangements provide solutions for optimal packings, efficient resource distribution, and cryptographic protocols. Do lattices also play a role in how the brain represents information? We focus on higher-dimensional stimulus domains, with particular emphasis on neural representations of physical space, and derive which neuronal lattice codes maximize spatial resolution. For mammals navigating on a surface, we show that the hexagonal activity patterns of grid cells are optimal. For species that move freely in three dimensions, a face-centered cubic lattice is best. This prediction could be tested experimentally in flying bats, arboreal monkeys, or marine mammals. More generally, our theory suggests that the brain encodes higher-dimensional sensory or cognitive variables with populations of grid-cell-like neurons whose activity patterns exhibit lattice structures at multiple, nested scales.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"05979"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.05979"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"05979","entryfile":"elife-05979-v2.xml","files":["elife-05979-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05979-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05979-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05979-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05979-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05979-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05979-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-05979-v1.xml"]}
