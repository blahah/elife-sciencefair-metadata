{"title":"Spatial cue reliability drives frequency tuning in the barn Owl's midbrain","author":[{"surname":"Cazettes","given-names":"Fanny"},{"surname":"Fischer","given-names":"Brian J"},{"surname":"Pena","given-names":"Jose L"}],"abstract":"The robust representation of the environment from unreliable sensory cues is vital for the efficient function of the brain. However, how the neural processing captures the most reliable cues is unknown. The interaural time difference (ITD) is the primary cue to localize sound in horizontal space. ITD is encoded in the firing rate of neurons that detect interaural phase difference (IPD). Due to the filtering effect of the head, IPD for a given location varies depending on the environmental context. We found that, in barn owls, at each location there is a frequency range where the head filtering yields the most reliable IPDs across contexts. Remarkably, the frequency tuning of space-specific neurons in the owl's midbrain varies with their preferred sound location, matching the range that carries the most reliable IPD. Thus, frequency tuning in the owl's space-specific neurons reflects a higher-order feature of the code that captures cue reliability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04854"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04854"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04854","entryfile":"elife-04854-v2.xml","files":["elife-04854-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04854-v1.xml"]}
