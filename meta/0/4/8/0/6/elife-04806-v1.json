Consistent with previous electron and fluorescence microscopic studies, cofilin formed clusters along actin filaments, where the filaments were 2-nm thicker and the helical pitch was âˆ¼25% shorter, compared to control filaments. Interestingly, the shortened helical pitch was propagated to the neighboring bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster, while the pitch on the barbed-end side was similar to the control. Thus, cofilin clusters induce distinctively asymmetric conformational changes in filaments. Consistent with the idea that cofilin favors actin structures with a shorter helical pitch, cofilin clusters grew unidirectionally toward the pointed-end of the filament. Severing was often observed near the boundaries between bare zones and clusters, but not necessarily at the boundaries.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04806"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04806"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04806","entryfile":"elife-04806-v1.xml","files":["elife-04806-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04806-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
