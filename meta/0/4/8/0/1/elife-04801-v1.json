To dissect the regulatory network of cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, we performed a chemical suppressor screen on zebrafish <italic>tremblor</italic> embryos, which suffer from Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion defects. Efsevin was identified based on its potent activity to restore coordinated contractions in <italic>tremblor</italic>. We show that efsevin binds to VDAC2, potentiates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and accelerates the transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores into mitochondria. In cardiomyocytes, efsevin restricts the temporal and spatial boundaries of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and thereby inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload-induced erratic Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and irregular contractions. We further show that overexpression of VDAC2 recapitulates the suppressive effect of efsevin on <italic>tremblor</italic> embryos whereas VDAC2 deficiency attenuates efsevin's rescue effect and that VDAC2 functions synergistically with MCU to suppress cardiac fibrillation in <italic>tremblor</italic>. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical modulatory role for VDAC2-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in the regulation of cardiac rhythmicity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04801"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04801"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04801","entryfile":"elife-04801-v1.xml","files":["elife-04801-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04801-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
