The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04837"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04837"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04837","entryfile":"elife-04837-v1.xml","files":["elife-04837-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04837-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
