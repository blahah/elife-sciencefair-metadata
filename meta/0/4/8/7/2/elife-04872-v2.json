In animals, the ISR is antagonised by selective eIF2α phosphatases comprising a catalytic protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) subunit in complex with a PPP1R15-type regulatory subunit. An unbiased search for additional conserved components of the PPP1R15-PP1 phosphatase identified monomeric G-actin. Like PP1, G-actin associated with the functional core of PPP1R15 family members and G-actin depletion, by the marine toxin jasplakinolide, destabilised the endogenous PPP1R15A-PP1 complex. The abundance of the ternary PPP1R15-PP1-G-actin complex was responsive to global changes in the polymeric status of actin, as was its eIF2α-directed phosphatase activity, while localised G-actin depletion at sites enriched for PPP1R15 enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation and the downstream ISR. G-actin's role as a stabilizer of the PPP1R15-containing holophosphatase provides a mechanism for integrating signals regulating actin dynamics with stresses that trigger the ISR.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04872"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04872"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04872","entryfile":"elife-04872-v2.xml","files":["elife-04872-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04872-v1.xml"]}
