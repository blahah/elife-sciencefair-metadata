Surprisingly, PPP1R15-PP1 binary complexes reconstituted in vitro lacked substrate selectivity. However, selectivity was restored by crude cell lysate or purified G-actin, which joined PPP1R15-PP1 to form a stable ternary complex. In crystal structures of the non-selective PPP1R15B-PP1G complex, the functional core of PPP1R15 made multiple surface contacts with PP1G, but at a distance from the active site, whereas in the substrate-selective ternary complex, actin contributes to one face of a platform encompassing the active site. Computational docking of the N-terminal lobe of eIF2a at this platform placed phosphorylated serine 51 near the active site. Mutagenesis of predicted surface-contacting residues enfeebled dephosphorylation, suggesting that avidity for the substrate plays an important role in imparting specificity on the PPP1R15B-PP1G-actin ternary complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04871"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04871"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04871","entryfile":"elife-04871-v2.xml","files":["elife-04871-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04871-v1.xml"]}
