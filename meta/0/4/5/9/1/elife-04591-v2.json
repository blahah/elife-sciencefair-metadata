The molecules and reactions that drive these dynamics in vivo are not well understood. In this study, we present evidence that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich proteins regulate the dynamics of P granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. The MEG (maternal-effect germline defective) proteins are germ plasm components that are required redundantly for fertility. We demonstrate that MEG-1 and MEG-3 are substrates of the kinase MBK-2/DYRK and the phosphatase PP2A<sup>PPTR−½</sup>. Phosphorylation of the MEGs promotes granule disassembly and dephosphorylation promotes granule assembly. Using lattice light sheet microscopy on live embryos, we show that GFP-tagged MEG-3 localizes to a dynamic domain that surrounds and penetrates each granule. We conclude that, despite their liquid-like behavior, P granules are non-homogeneous structures whose assembly in embryos is regulated by phosphorylation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04591"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04591"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04591","entryfile":"elife-04591-v2.xml","files":["elife-04591-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig5-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04591-v1.xml"]}
