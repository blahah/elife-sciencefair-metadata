We examine the possibility that functional connectivity also reflects short-term changes in synaptic efficacy. We demonstrate that paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) near ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and primary motor cortex (M1) with a short 8-ms inter-pulse interval evoking synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activity and which strengthens interregional connectivity between the two areas in a pattern consistent with Hebbian plasticity, leads to increased functional connectivity between PMv and M1 as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, we show that strengthening connectivity between these nodes has effects on a wider network of areas, such as decreasing coupling in a parallel motor programming stream. A control experiment revealed that identical TMS pulses at identical frequencies caused no change in fMRI-measured functional connectivity when the inter-pulse-interval was too long for Hebbian-like plasticity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04585"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04585"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"04585","entryfile":"elife-04585-v3.xml","files":["elife-04585-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04585-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04585-v1.xml","elife-04585-v2.xml"]}
