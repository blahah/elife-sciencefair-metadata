This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘The CD47-signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa) interaction is a therapeutic target for human solid tumors’ by <xref>Willingham et al., 2012</xref>, published in <italic>PNAS</italic> in 2012. The key experiments being replicated are those reported in Figure 6A–C and Table S4. In these experiments, <xref>Willingham et al., 2012</xref> test the safety and efficacy of anti-CD47 antibody treatment in immune competent mice utilizing a syngeneic model of mammary tumor growth in FVB mice. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04586"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04586"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04586","entryfile":"elife-04586-v1.xml","files":[]}
