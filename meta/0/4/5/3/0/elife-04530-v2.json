Less clear is whether intergenic lncRNAs commonly regulate transcription by modulating chromatin at genomically distant loci. Here, we report both genomically local and distal RNA-dependent roles of <italic>Dali</italic>, a conserved central nervous system expressed intergenic lncRNA. <italic>Dali</italic> is transcribed downstream of the <italic>Pou3f3</italic> transcription factor gene and its depletion disrupts the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Locally, <italic>Dali</italic> transcript regulates transcription of the <italic>Pou3f3</italic> locus. Distally, it preferentially targets active promoters and regulates expression of neural differentiation genes, in part through physical association with the POU3F3 protein. <italic>Dali</italic> interacts with the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase in mouse and human and regulates DNA methylation status of CpG island-associated promoters in <italic>trans</italic>. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a single intergenic lncRNA controls the activity and methylation of genomically distal regulatory elements to modulate large-scale transcriptional programmes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04530"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04530"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04530","entryfile":"elife-04530-v2.xml","files":["elife-04530-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04530-v1.xml"]}
