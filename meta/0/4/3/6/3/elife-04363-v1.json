This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Tumour vascularization via endothelial differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells’ by Ricci-Vitiani and colleagues, published in <italic>Nature</italic> in 2010 (<xref>Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 10B (<xref>Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>), which demonstrate that glioblastoma stem-like cells can derive into endothelial cells, and can be selectively ablated to reduce tumor progression in vivo, and Supplementary Figures S10C and S10D (<xref>Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>), which demonstrate that fully differentiated glioblastoma cells cannot form functionally relevant endothelium. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04363"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04363"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04363","entryfile":"elife-04363-v1.xml","files":[]}
