In this study, we show that mouse <italic>Sema5A</italic> negatively regulates synaptogenesis in early, developmentally born, hippocampal dentate granule cells (GCs). Sema5A is strongly expressed by GCs and regulates dendritic spine density in a cell-autonomous manner. In the adult mouse brain, newly born <italic>Sema5A</italic><sup>undefined</sup> GCs show an increase in dendritic spine density and increased AMPA-type synaptic responses. Sema5A signals through PlexinA2 co-expressed by GCs, and the PlexinA2-RasGAP activity is necessary to suppress spinogenesis. Like <italic>Sema5A</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mutants, <italic>PlexinA2</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mice show an increase in GC glutamatergic synapses, and we show that <italic>Sema5A</italic> and <italic>PlexinA2</italic> genetically interact with respect to GC spine phenotypes. <italic>Sema5A</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mice display deficits in social interaction, a hallmark of autism-spectrum-disorders. These experiments identify novel intra-dendritic Sema5A/PlexinA2 interactions that inhibit excitatory synapse formation in developmentally born and adult-born GCs, and they provide support for SEMA5A contributions to autism-spectrum-disorders.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04390"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04390"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04390","entryfile":"elife-04390-v2.xml","files":["elife-04390-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04390-v1.xml"]}
