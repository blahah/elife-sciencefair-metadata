In alkaliphilic prokaryotes, high external pH activates voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>), which allows Na<sup>+</sup> to enter and be used as substrate for cation/proton antiporters responsible for cytoplasmic pH homeostasis. Here, we describe a new member of the prokaryotic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel family (NsvBa; <underline>N</underline>on-<underline>s</underline>elective <underline>v</underline>oltage-gated, <italic>acillus lcalophilus</italic>) that is nonselective among Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. Mutations in NsvBa can convert the nonselective filter into one that discriminates for Na<sup>+</sup> or divalent cations. Gain-of-function experiments demonstrate the portability of ion selectivity with filter mutations to other <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels. Increasing pH and temperature shifts their activation threshold towards their native resting membrane potential. Furthermore, we find drugs that target <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels also block the growth of the bacteria. This work identifies some of the adaptations to achieve ion discrimination and gating in <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04387"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04387"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04387","entryfile":"elife-04387-v1.xml","files":["elife-04387-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04387-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
