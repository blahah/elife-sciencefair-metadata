However, it is rare for researchers to perform or publish direct replications of existing results. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is an open investigation of reproducibility in preclinical cancer biology research. We have identified 50 high impact cancer biology articles published in the period 2010-2012, and plan to replicate a subset of experimental results from each article. A Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for each subset of experiments will be peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The results of these experiments will then be published in a Replication Study. The resulting open methodology and dataset will provide evidence about the reproducibility of high-impact results, and an opportunity to identify predictors of reproducibility.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04333"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04333"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04333","entryfile":"elife-04333-v1.xml","files":["elife-04333-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
