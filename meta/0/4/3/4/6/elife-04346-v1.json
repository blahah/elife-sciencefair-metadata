{"title":"Linking traits based on their shared molecular mechanisms","author":[{"surname":"Oren","given-names":"Yael"},{"surname":"Nachshon","given-names":"Aharon"},{"surname":"Frishberg","given-names":"Amit"},{"surname":"Wilentzik","given-names":"Roni"},{"surname":"Gat-Viks","given-names":"Irit"}],"abstract":"There is growing recognition that co-morbidity and co-occurrence of disease traits are often determined by shared genetic and molecular mechanisms. In most cases, however, the specific mechanisms that lead to such traitâ€“trait relationships are yet unknown. Here we present an analysis of a broad spectrum of behavioral and physiological traits together with gene-expression measurements across genetically diverse mouse strains. We develop an unbiased methodology that constructs potentially overlapping groups of traits and resolves their underlying combination of genetic loci and molecular mechanisms. For example, our method predicts that genetic variation in the <italic>Klf7</italic> gene may influence gene transcripts in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, which in turn affect 17 behavioral traits following morphine injection; this predicted effect of <italic>Klf7</italic> is consistent with an in vitro perturbation of <italic>Klf7</italic> in bone marrow cells. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of studying hidden causative mechanisms that lead to relationships between complex traits.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04346"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04346"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04346","entryfile":"elife-04346-v1.xml","files":["elife-04346-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04346-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
