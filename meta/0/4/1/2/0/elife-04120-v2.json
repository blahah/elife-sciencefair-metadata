Multiple Rev subunits assemble on the Rev Response Element (RRE), a structured region present in these RNAs, and direct their export through the Crm1 pathway. Rev-RRE assembly occurs via several Rev oligomerization and RNA-binding steps, but how these steps are coordinated to form an export–competent complex is unclear. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a Rev dimer-RRE complex, revealing a dramatic rearrangement of the Rev-dimer upon RRE binding through re-packing of its hydrophobic protein–protein interface. Rev-RNA recognition relies on sequence-specific contacts at the well-characterized IIB site and local RNA architecture at the second site. The structure supports a model in which the RRE utilizes the inherent plasticity of Rev subunit interfaces to guide the formation of a functional complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04120"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04120"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04120","entryfile":"elife-04120-v2.xml","files":["elife-04120-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04120-v1.xml"]}
