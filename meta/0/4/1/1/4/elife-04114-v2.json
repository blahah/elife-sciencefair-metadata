They occur in ill-defined reverse-transcription- and pre-integration-complexes (RTC, PIC) with various host and viral proteins implicated. In this study, we report quantitative detection of functional RTC/PIC by labeling nascent DNA combined with detection of viral integrase. We show that the viral CA (capsid) protein remains associated with cytoplasmic RTC/PIC but is lost on nuclear PIC in a HeLa-derived cell line. In contrast, nuclear PIC were almost always CA-positive in primary human macrophages, indicating nuclear import of capsids or capsid-like structures. We further show that the CA-targeted inhibitor PF74 exhibits a bimodal mechanism, blocking RTC/PIC association with the host factor CPSF6 and nuclear entry at low, and abrogating reverse transcription at high concentrations. The newly developed system is ideally suited for studying retroviral post-entry events and the roles of host factors including DNA sensors and signaling molecules.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04114"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04114"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04114","entryfile":"elife-04114-v2.xml","files":["elife-04114-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig1-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04114-v1.xml"]}
