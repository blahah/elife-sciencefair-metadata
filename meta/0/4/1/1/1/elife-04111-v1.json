In contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, eggs of the beetle <italic>Tribolium</italic> are protected by a serosa, an extraembryonic epithelium that is present in all insects except higher flies. In this study, we test a possible immune function of this frontier epithelium using <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi-mediated deletion. First, we show that bacteria propagate twice as fast in serosa-less eggs. Then, we compare the complete transcriptomes of wild-type, control RNAi, and <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi eggs before and after sterile or septic injury. Infection induces genes involved in Toll and IMD-signaling, melanisation, production of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides in wild-type eggs but not in serosa-less eggs. Finally, we demonstrate constitutive and induced immune gene expression in the serosal epithelium using in situ hybridization. We conclude that the serosa provides insect eggs with a full-range innate immune response.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04111"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04111"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04111","entryfile":"elife-04111-v1.xml","files":["elife-04111-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04111-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04111-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04111-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04111-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04111-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04111-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
