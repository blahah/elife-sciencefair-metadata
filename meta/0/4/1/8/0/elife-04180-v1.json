This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Melanoma genome sequencing reveals frequent <italic>PREX2</italic> mutations’ by Berger and colleagues, published in <italic>Nature</italic> in 2012 (<xref>Berger et al., 2012</xref>). The key experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S6. In these experiments, Berger and colleagues show that somatic <italic>PREX2</italic> mutations identified through whole-genome sequencing of human melanoma can contribute to enhanced lethality of tumor xenografts in nude mice (Figure 3B, S6B, and S6C; <xref>Berger et al., 2012</xref>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04180"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04180"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04180","entryfile":"elife-04180-v1.xml","files":[]}
