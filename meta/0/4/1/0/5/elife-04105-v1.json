This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Senescence surveillance of pre-malignant hepatocytes limits liver cancer development’ by <xref>Kang et al. (2011)</xref>, published in Nature in 2011. The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3B, 3C, 3E, and 4A. In these experiments, <xref>Kang et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrate the phenomenon of oncogene-induced cellular senescence and immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells after intrahepatic injection of <italic>NRAS</italic> (Figures 2I, 3B, 3C, and 3E). Additionally, <xref>Kang et al. (2011)</xref> show the specific necessity of CD4+ T cells for immunoclearance of senescent cells (Figure 4A). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04105"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04105"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04105","entryfile":"elife-04105-v1.xml","files":[]}
