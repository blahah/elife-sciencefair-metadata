Natural killer (NK) cells are essential tumor-killing effector cells of the innate immune system; however, little is known about whether or how other immune cells recognize tumor cells to assist NK cells. Here, we show that the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages is critical to NK-mediated killing of tumor cells that express N-glycan structures at high levels. Receptor recognition of these tumor cells causes the activation of the IRF5 transcription factor and downstream gene induction for the full-blown tumoricidal activity of NK cells. Consistent with this, we show exacerbated in vivo tumor growth in mice genetically deficient in either Dectin-1 or IRF5. The critical contribution of Dectin-1 in the recognition of and signaling by tumor cells may offer new insight into the anti-tumor immune system with therapeutic implications.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04177"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04177"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04177","entryfile":"elife-04177-v2.xml","files":["elife-04177-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig5-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig5-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04177-v1.xml"]}
