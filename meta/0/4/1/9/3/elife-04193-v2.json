{"title":"FGF14 modulates resurgent sodium current in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons","author":[{"surname":"Yan","given-names":"Haidun"},{"surname":"Pablo","given-names":"Juan L"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Chaojian"},{"surname":"Pitt","given-names":"Geoffrey S"}],"abstract":"Rapid firing of cerebellar Purkinje neurons is facilitated in part by a voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<sub>V</sub>) ‘resurgent’ current, which allows renewed Na<sup>+</sup> influx during membrane repolarization. Resurgent current results from unbinding of a blocking particle that competes with normal channel inactivation. The underlying molecular components contributing to resurgent current have not been fully identified. In this study, we show that the Na<sub>V</sub> channel auxiliary subunit FGF14 ‘b’ isoform, a locus for inherited spinocerebellar ataxias, controls resurgent current and repetitive firing in Purkinje neurons. FGF14 knockdown biased Na<sub>V</sub> channels towards the inactivated state by decreasing channel availability, diminishing the ‘late’ Na<sub>V</sub> current, and accelerating channel inactivation rate, thereby reducing resurgent current and repetitive spiking. Critical for these effects was both the alternatively spliced FGF14b N-terminus and direct interaction between FGF14b and the Na<sub>V</sub> C-terminus. Together, these data suggest that the FGF14b N-terminus is a potent regulator of resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current in cerebellar Purkinje neurons.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04193"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04193"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04193","entryfile":"elife-04193-v2.xml","files":["elife-04193-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04193-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04193-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04193-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04193-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04193-v1.xml"]}
