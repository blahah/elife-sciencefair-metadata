Plasmalemma clathrin-coated structures range from unitary domed assemblies to expansive planar constructions with internal or flanking invaginated buds. Precisely how these morphologically-distinct coats are formed, and whether all are functionally equivalent for selective cargo internalization is still disputed. We have disrupted the genes encoding a set of early arriving clathrin-coat constituents, FCHO1 and FCHO2, in HeLa cells. Endocytic coats do not disappear in this genetic background; rather clustered planar lattices predominate and endocytosis slows, but does not cease. The central linker of FCHO proteins acts as an allosteric regulator of the prime endocytic adaptor, AP-2. By loading AP-2 onto the plasma membrane, FCHO proteins provide a parallel pathway for AP-2 activation and clathrin-coat fabrication. Further, the steady-state morphology of clathrin-coated structures appears to be a manifestation of the availability of the muniscin linker during lattice polymerization.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04137"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04137"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04137","entryfile":"elife-04137-v2.xml","files":["elife-04137-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig13-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04137-v1.xml"]}
