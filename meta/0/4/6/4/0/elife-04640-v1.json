The discovery of anti-resistance drug combinations is challenging as resistance can arise by diverse escape mechanisms. To address this challenge, we improved and applied the experimental-computational perturbation biology method. Using statistical inference, we build network models from high-throughput measurements of molecular and phenotypic responses to combinatorial targeted perturbations. The models are computationally executed to predict the effects of thousands of untested perturbations. In RAF-inhibitor resistant melanoma cells, we measured 143 proteomic/phenotypic entities under 89 perturbation conditions and predicted c-Myc as an effective therapeutic co-target with BRAF or MEK. Experiments using the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 affecting the level of c-Myc protein and protein kinase inhibitors targeting the ERK pathway confirmed the prediction. In conclusion, we propose an anti-cancer strategy of co-targeting a specific upstream alteration and a general downstream point of vulnerability to prevent or overcome resistance to targeted drugs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04640"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04640"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04640","entryfile":"elife-04640-v1.xml","files":["elife-04640-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04640-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
