We report the first genome-wide study of NCO events in humans. Using SNP array data from 98 meioses, we identified 103 sites affected by NCO, of which 50/52 were confirmed in sequence data. Overlap with double strand break (DSB) hotspots indicates that most of the events are likely of meiotic origin. We estimate that a site is involved in a NCO at a rate of 5.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>/bp/generation, consistent with sperm-typing studies, and infer that tract lengths span at least an order of magnitude. Observed NCO events show strong allelic bias at heterozygous AT/GC SNPs, with 68% (58–78%) transmitting GC alleles (p = 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Strikingly, in 4 of 15 regions with resequencing data, multiple disjoint NCO tracts cluster in close proximity (∼20–30 kb), a phenomenon not previously seen in mammals.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04637"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04637"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04637","entryfile":"elife-04637-v2.xml","files":["elife-04637-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04637-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04637-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04637-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04637-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04637-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04637-v1.xml"]}
