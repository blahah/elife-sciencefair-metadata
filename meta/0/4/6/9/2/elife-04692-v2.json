We develop a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites, and validate it against data from tropical strains of <italic>P. vivax</italic>. The within-host model is embedded in a <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites, and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission. Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04692"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04692"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04692","entryfile":"elife-04692-v2.xml","files":["elife-04692-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04692-v1.xml"]}
