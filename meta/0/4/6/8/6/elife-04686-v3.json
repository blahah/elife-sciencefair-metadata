We obtained insight into this process by developing atomic models for no-nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5–6 Å resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, we infer a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment, mediated by a universally conserved ‘linchpin’ residue in kinesin (N255), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo, via kinesin's ‘neck linker’ element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer ‘gate’ each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04686"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04686"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04686","entryfile":"elife-04686-v3.xml","files":["elife-04686-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04686-v1.xml","elife-04686-v2.xml"]}
