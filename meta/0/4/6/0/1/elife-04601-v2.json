The most common membrane constriction system in prokaryotes is based on the tubulin homologue FtsZ, whose filaments in <italic>E. coli</italic> are anchored to the membrane by FtsA and enable the formation of the Z-ring and divisome. The precise architecture of the FtsZ ring has remained enigmatic. In this study, we report three-dimensional arrangements of FtsZ and FtsA filaments in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and inside constricting liposomes by means of electron cryomicroscopy and cryotomography. In vivo and in vitro, the Z-ring is composed of a small, single-layered band of filaments parallel to the membrane, creating a continuous ring through lateral filament contacts. Visualisation of the in vitro reconstituted constrictions as well as a complete tracing of the helical paths of the filaments with a molecular model favour a mechanism of FtsZ-based membrane constriction that is likely to be accompanied by filament sliding.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04601"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04601"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04601","entryfile":"elife-04601-v2.xml","files":["elife-04601-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04601-v1.xml"]}
