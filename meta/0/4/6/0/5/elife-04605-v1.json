Here we show that compensatory arm usage in individuals born without a hand (one-handers) reflects functional connectivity of spontaneous brain activity in the cortical hand region. Compared with two-handed controls, one-handers showed reduced symmetry of hand region inter-hemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and corticospinal white matter microstructure. Nevertheless, those one-handers who more frequently use their residual (handless) arm for typically bimanual daily tasks also showed more symmetrical functional connectivity of the hand region, demonstrating that adaptive behaviour drives long-range brain organisation. We therefore suggest that compensatory arm usage maintains symmetrical sensorimotor functional connectivity in one-handers. Since variability in spontaneous functional connectivity in our study reflects ecological behaviour, we propose that inter-hemispheric symmetry, typically observed in resting sensorimotor networks, depends on coordinated motor behaviour in daily life.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04605"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04605"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04605","entryfile":"elife-04605-v1.xml","files":["elife-04605-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04605-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
