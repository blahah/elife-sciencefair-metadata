{"title":"Registered report: Tumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretion","author":[{"surname":"Blum","given-names":"David"},{"surname":"LaBarge","given-names":"Samuel"}],"abstract":"The <ext-link>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 papers in the field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Tumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretion’ by Straussman and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (<xref>Straussman et al., 2012</xref>). The key experiments being replicated in this study are from Figure 2A, C, and D (and Supplemental Figure 11) and Figure 4C (and Supplemental Figure 19) (<xref>Straussman et al., 2012</xref>). Figure 2 demonstrates resistance to drug sensitivity conferred by co-culture with some stromal cell lines and identifies the secreted factor responsible as HGF. In Figure 4, Straussman and colleagues show that blocking the HGF receptor MET abrogates HGF’s rescue of drug sensitivity. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04034"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04034"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04034","entryfile":"elife-04034-v1.xml","files":[]}
