{"title":"Registered report: Widespread potential for growth factor-driven resistance to anticancer kinase inhibitors","author":[{"surname":"Greenfield","given-names":"Edward"},{"surname":"Griner","given-names":"Erin"}],"abstract":"The <ext-link>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 papers in the field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Widespread potential for growth-factor-driven resistance to anticancer kinase inhibitors’ by Wilson and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (<xref>Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figure 2B and C. In these experiments, Wilson and colleagues show that sensitivity to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors can be bypassed by various ligands through reactivation of downstream signaling pathways (Figure 2A; <xref>Wilson et al., 2012</xref>), and that blocking the receptors for these bypassing ligands abrogates their ability to block sensitivity to the original RTK inhibitor (Figure 2C; <xref>Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04037"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04037"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04037","entryfile":"elife-04037-v1.xml","files":[]}
