{"title":"Nanodomain coupling explains Ca<sup>2+</sup> independence of transmitter release time course at a fast central synapse","author":[{"surname":"Arai","given-names":"Itaru"},{"surname":"Jonas","given-names":"Peter"}],"abstract":"A puzzling property of synaptic transmission, originally established at the neuromuscular junction, is that the time course of transmitter release is independent of the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>), whereas the rate of release is highly [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent. Here, we examine the time course of release at inhibitory basket cell-Purkinje cell synapses and show that it is independent of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Modeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent transmitter release suggests that the invariant time course of release critically depends on tight coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sensors. Experiments with exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators reveal that channel-sensor coupling at basket cell-Purkinje cell synapses is very tight, with a mean distance of 10â€“20 nm. Thus, tight channel-sensor coupling provides a mechanistic explanation for the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the time course of release.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04057"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04057"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04057","entryfile":"elife-04057-v1.xml","files":["elife-04057-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04057-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04057-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04057-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04057-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04057-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04057-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
