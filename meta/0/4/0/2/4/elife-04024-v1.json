This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Transcriptional amplification in tumor cells with elevated c-Myc’ by <xref>Lin et al. (2012)</xref>, published in <italic>Cell</italic> in 2012. The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3E and 3F. In these experiments, elevated levels of c-Myc in the P493-6 cell model of Burkitt's lymphoma results in an increase of the total level of RNA using UV/VIS spectrophotometry (Figure 3E; <xref>Lin et al., 2012</xref>) and on the mRNA levels/cell for a large set of genes using digital gene expression technology (Figure 3F; <xref>Lin et al., 2012</xref>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04024"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04024"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04024","entryfile":"elife-04024-v1.xml","files":[]}
