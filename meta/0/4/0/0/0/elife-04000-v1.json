When segment function is disrupted, a range of pathological features are presented. Little is known about nephron patterning during embryogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the early nephron is patterned by a gradient in β-catenin activity along the axis of the nephron tubule. By modifying β-catenin activity, we force cells within nephrons to differentiate according to the imposed β-catenin activity level, thereby causing spatial shifts in nephron segments. The β-catenin signalling gradient interacts with the BMP pathway which, through PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling, antagonises β-catenin activity and promotes segment identities associated with low β-catenin activity. β-catenin activity and PI3K signalling also integrate with Notch signalling to control segmentation: modulating β-catenin activity or PI3K rescues segment identities normally lost by inhibition of Notch. Our data therefore identifies a molecular network for nephron patterning.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04000"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04000"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04000","entryfile":"elife-04000-v1.xml","files":["elife-04000-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04000-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
