These cell classes play key roles in regulating local circuit operations and rhythmogenesis by releasing GABA in precise temporal patterns onto distinct domains of principal cells. In this study, we show that each of the three major PV cell classes further splits into functionally distinct sub-classes during fast network events in vivo. During the slower (<10 Hz) theta oscillations, each cell class exhibited its own characteristic, relatively uniform firing behavior. However, during faster (>90 Hz) oscillations, within-class differences in PV interneuron discharges emerged, which segregated along specific features of dendritic structure or somatic location. Functional divergence of PV sub-classes during fast but not slow network oscillations effectively doubles the repertoire of spatio-temporal patterns of GABA release available for rapid circuit operations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04006"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04006"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04006","entryfile":"elife-04006-v2.xml","files":["elife-04006-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04006-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04006-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04006-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04006-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04006-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04006-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04006-v1.xml"]}
