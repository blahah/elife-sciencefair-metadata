{"title":"Learning the specific quality of taste reinforcement in larval Drosophila","author":[{"surname":"Schleyer","given-names":"Michael"},{"surname":"Miura","given-names":"Daisuke"},{"surname":"Tanimura","given-names":"Teiichi"},{"surname":"Gerber","given-names":"Bertram"}],"abstract":"The only property of reinforcement insects are commonly thought to learn about is its value. We show that larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> not only remember the value of reinforcement (How much?), but also its quality (What?). This is demonstrated both within the appetitive domain by using sugar vs amino acid as different reward qualities, and within the aversive domain by using bitter vs high-concentration salt as different qualities of punishment. From the available literature, such nuanced memories for the quality of reinforcement are unexpected and pose a challenge to present models of how insect memory is organized. Given that animals as simple as larval <italic>Drosophila</italic>, endowed with but 10,000 neurons, operate with both reinforcement value and quality, we suggest that both are fundamental aspects of mnemonic processingâ€”in any brain.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04711"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04711"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04711","entryfile":"elife-04711-v1.xml","files":["elife-04711-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04711-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04711-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04711-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04711-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04711-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04711-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04711-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
