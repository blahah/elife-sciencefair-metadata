{"title":"Enhanced homology-directed human genome engineering by controlled timing of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery","author":[{"surname":"Lin","given-names":"Steven"},{"surname":"Staahl","given-names":"Brett T"},{"surname":"Alla","given-names":"Ravi K"},{"surname":"Doudna","given-names":"Jennifer A"}],"abstract":"The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a robust genome editing technology that works in human cells, animals and plants based on the RNA-programmed DNA cleaving activity of the Cas9 enzyme. Building on previous work (<xref>Jinek et al., 2013</xref>), we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells. Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized. This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04766"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04766"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04766","entryfile":"elife-04766-v2.xml","files":["elife-04766-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04766-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04766-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04766-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04766-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04766-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04766-v1.xml"]}
