Previously we have shown that Cx26 hemichannels are directly opened by CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref>Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). However the effects of human disease-causing mutations on the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26 are entirely unknown. Here, we report the first connection between the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26 and human pathology, by demonstrating that Cx26 hemichannels with the mutation A88V, linked to Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome, are both CO<sub>2</sub> insensitive and associated with disordered breathing in humans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04249"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04249"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04249","entryfile":"elife-04249-v2.xml","files":["elife-04249-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04249-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04249-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04249-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04249-v1.xml"]}
