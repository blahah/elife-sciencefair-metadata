Upon binding to the membrane, they convert from the soluble monomeric form to oligomeric, membrane-inserted pores. Using real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy (EM), and atomic structure fitting, we have mapped the structure and assembly pathways of a bacterial CDC in unprecedented detail and accuracy, focussing on suilysin from <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic>. We show that suilysin assembly is a noncooperative process that is terminated before the protein inserts into the membrane. The resulting ring-shaped pores and kinetically trapped arc-shaped assemblies are all seen to perforate the membrane, as also visible by the ejection of its lipids. Membrane insertion requires a concerted conformational change of the monomeric subunits, with a marked expansion in pore diameter due to large changes in subunit structure and packing.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04247"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04247"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04247","entryfile":"elife-04247-v2.xml","files":["elife-04247-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04247-v1.xml"]}
