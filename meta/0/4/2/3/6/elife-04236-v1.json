However, the 3D spatial organization of cis-elements and how such sub-nuclear structures influence TF activity remain poorly understood. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet imaging, single-molecule tracking, numerical simulations, and ChIP-exo mapping to localize and functionally probe Sox2 enhancer-organization in living embryonic stem cells. Sox2 enhancers form 3D-clusters that are segregated from heterochromatin but overlap with a subset of Pol II enriched regions. Sox2 searches for specific binding targets via a 3D-diffusion dominant mode when shuttling long-distances between clusters while chromatin-bound states predominate within individual clusters. Thus, enhancer clustering may reduce global search efficiency but enables rapid local fine-tuning of TF search parameters. Our results suggest an integrated model linking cis-element 3D spatial distribution to local-versus-global target search modalities essential for regulating eukaryotic gene transcription.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04236"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04236"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04236","entryfile":"elife-04236-v1.xml","files":["elife-04236-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04236-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
