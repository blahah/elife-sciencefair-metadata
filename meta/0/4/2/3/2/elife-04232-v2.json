We recently reported that rodent malaria parasites infect erythroblasts that express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, which are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contributes to the protection of mice against blood-stage malaria in a Fas ligand (FasL)-dependent manner. Erythroblasts infected with malarial parasites express the death receptor Fas. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induce the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the infected erythroblasts in a cell-to-cell contact-dependent manner. PS enhances the engulfment of the infected erythroid cells by phagocytes. As a PS receptor, T-cell immunoglobulin-domain and mucin-domain-containing molecule 4 (Tim-4) contributes to the phagocytosis of malaria-parasite-infected cells. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective immunity exerted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in collaboration with phagocytes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04232"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04232"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04232","entryfile":"elife-04232-v2.xml","files":["elife-04232-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04232-v1.xml"]}
