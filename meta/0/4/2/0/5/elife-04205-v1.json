{"title":"Evolved differences in larval social behavior mediated by novel pheromones","author":[{"surname":"Mast","given-names":"Joshua D"},{"surname":"De Moraes","given-names":"Consuelo M"},{"surname":"Alborn","given-names":"Hans T"},{"surname":"Lavis","given-names":"Luke D"},{"surname":"Stern","given-names":"David L"}],"abstract":"Pheromones, chemical signals that convey social information, mediate many insect social behaviors, including navigation and aggregation. Several studies have suggested that behavior during the immature larval stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development is influenced by pheromones, but none of these compounds or the pheromone-receptor neurons that sense them have been identified. Here we report a larval pheromone-signaling pathway. We found that larvae produce two novel long-chain fatty acids that are attractive to other larvae. We identified a single larval chemosensory neuron that detects these molecules. Two members of the <italic>pickpocket</italic> family of <italic>DEG/ENaC</italic> channel subunits (<italic>ppk23</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic>) are required to respond to these pheromones. This pheromone system is evolving quickly, since the larval exudates of <italic>D. simulans</italic>, the sister species of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, are not attractive to other larvae. Our results define a new pheromone signaling system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that shares characteristics with pheromone systems in a wide diversity of insects.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04205"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04205"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"04205","entryfile":"elife-04205-v1.xml","files":["elife-04205-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04205-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
