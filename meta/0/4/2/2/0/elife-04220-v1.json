Here, we analyze a complex food seeking behavior in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) to derive a general theory describing different searches. We show that <italic>C. elegans</italic>, like many other animals, uses a multi-stage search for food, where they initially explore a small area intensively (‘local search’) before switching to explore a much larger area (‘global search’). We demonstrate that these search strategies as well as the transition between them can be quantitatively explained by a maximally informative search strategy, where the searcher seeks to continuously maximize information about the target. Although performing maximally informative search is computationally demanding, we show that a drift-diffusion model can approximate it successfully with just three neurons. Our study reveals how the maximally informative search strategy can be implemented and adopted to different search conditions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04220"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04220"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04220","entryfile":"elife-04220-v1.xml","files":["elife-04220-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04220-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04220-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04220-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04220-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04220-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04220-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04220-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
