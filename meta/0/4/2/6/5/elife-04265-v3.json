To overcome this, we performed an enhancer screen for developmental defects caused by compromising both global miRISC function and individual genes in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Among 126 interactors with miRNAs, we surprisingly found the CED-3 caspase that has only been well studied for its role in promoting apoptosis, mostly through protein activation. We provide evidence for a non-apoptotic function of CED-3 caspase that regulates multiple developmental events through proteolytic inactivation. Specifically, LIN-14, LIN-28, and DISL-2 proteins are known miRNA targets, key regulators of developmental timing, and/or stem cell pluripotency factors involved in miRNA processing. We show CED-3 cleaves these proteins in vitro. We also show CED-3 down-regulates LIN-28 in vivo, possibly rendering it more susceptible to proteasomal degradation. This mechanism may critically contribute to the robustness of gene expression dynamics governing proper developmental control.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04265"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04265"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04265","entryfile":"elife-04265-v3.xml","files":["elife-04265-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig10-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig8-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig9-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig9-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig9-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig9-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-04265-v1.xml","elife-04265-v2.xml"]}
