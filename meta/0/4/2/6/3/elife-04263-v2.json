We show that post-transcriptional mechanisms restrict miR-128 accumulation to post-mitotic neurons during mouse corticogenesis and in adult stem cell niches. Whereas premature miR-128 expression in progenitors for upper layer neurons leads to impaired neuronal migration and inappropriate branching, sponge-mediated inhibition results in overmigration. Within the upper layers, premature miR-128 expression reduces the complexity of dendritic arborization, associated with altered electrophysiological properties. We show that <italic>Phf6</italic>, a gene mutated in the cognitive disorder BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, is an important regulatory target for miR-128. Restoring PHF6 expression counteracts the deleterious effect of miR-128 on neuronal migration, outgrowth and intrinsic physiological properties. Our results place miR-128 upstream of PHF6 in a pathway vital for cortical lamination as well as for the development of neuronal morphology and intrinsic excitability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04263"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04263"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04263","entryfile":"elife-04263-v2.xml","files":["elife-04263-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04263-v1.xml"]}
