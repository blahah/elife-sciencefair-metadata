We present two crystal structures of engineered U1 sub-structures, which together reveal at atomic resolution an almost complete network of protein–protein and RNA-protein interactions within U1 snRNP, and show how the 5′ splice site of pre-mRNA is recognised by U1 snRNP. The zinc-finger of U1-C interacts with the duplex between pre-mRNA and the 5′-end of U1 snRNA. The binding of the RNA duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between U1-C and the RNA backbone around the splice junction but U1-C makes no base-specific contacts with pre-mRNA. The structure, together with RNA binding assays, shows that the selection of 5′-splice site nucleotides by U1 snRNP is achieved predominantly through basepairing with U1 snRNA whilst U1-C fine-tunes relative affinities of mismatched 5′-splice sites.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04986"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04986"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04986","entryfile":"elife-04986-v1.xml","files":["elife-04986-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04986-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
