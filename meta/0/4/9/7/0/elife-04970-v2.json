{"title":"Bridged filaments of histone-like nucleoid structuring protein pause RNA polymerase and aid termination in bacteria","author":[{"surname":"Kotlajich","given-names":"Matthew V"},{"surname":"Hron","given-names":"Daniel R"},{"surname":"Boudreau","given-names":"Beth A"},{"surname":"Sun","given-names":"Zhiqiang"},{"surname":"Lyubchenko","given-names":"Yuri L"},{"surname":"Landick","given-names":"Robert"}],"abstract":"Bacterial H-NS forms nucleoprotein filaments that spread on DNA and bridge distant DNA sites. H-NS filaments co-localize with sites of Rho-dependent termination in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, but their direct effects on transcriptional pausing and termination are untested. In this study, we report that bridged H-NS filaments strongly increase pausing by <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase at a subset of pause sites with high potential for backtracking. Bridged but not linear H-NS filaments promoted Rho-dependent termination by increasing pause dwell times and the kinetic window for Rho action. By observing single H-NS filaments and elongating RNA polymerase molecules using atomic force microscopy, we established that bridged filaments surround paused complexes. Our results favor a model in which H-NS-constrained changes in DNA supercoiling driven by transcription promote pausing at backtracking-susceptible sites. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for H-NS stimulation of Rho-dependent termination in horizontally transferred genes and during pervasive antisense and noncoding transcription in bacteria.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04970"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04970"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04970","entryfile":"elife-04970-v2.xml","files":["elife-04970-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04970-v1.xml"]}
