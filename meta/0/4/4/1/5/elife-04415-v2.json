{"title":"<italic>Cis</italic>-interactions between Notch and its ligands block ligand-independent Notch activity","author":[{"surname":"Palmer","given-names":"William Hunt"},{"surname":"Jia","given-names":"Dongyu"},{"surname":"Deng","given-names":"Wu-Min"}],"abstract":"The Notch pathway is integrated into numerous developmental processes and therefore is fine-tuned on many levels, including receptor production, endocytosis, and degradation. Notch is further characterized by a twofold relationship with its Delta-Serrate (DSL) ligands, as ligands from opposing cells (<italic>trans</italic>-ligands) activate Notch, whereas ligands expressed in the same cell (<italic>cis</italic>-ligands) inhibit signaling. We show that cells without both <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>ligands can mediate Notch-dependent developmental events during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, indicating ligand-independent Notch activity occurs when the receptor is free of <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-ligands. Furthermore, <italic>cis</italic>-ligands can reduce Notch activity in endogenous and genetically induced situations of elevated <italic>trans</italic>-ligand-independent Notch signaling. We conclude that <italic>cis</italic>-expressed ligands exert their repressive effect on Notch signaling in cases of <italic>trans</italic>-ligand-independent activation, and propose a new function of <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition which buffers cells against accidental Notch activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04415"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04415"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04415","entryfile":"elife-04415-v2.xml","files":["elife-04415-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04415-v1.xml"]}
