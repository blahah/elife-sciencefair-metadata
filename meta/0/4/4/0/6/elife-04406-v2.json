However, the pathways underlying ILC development remain unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor NFIL3 directs the development of a committed bone marrow precursor that differentiates into all known ILC lineages. NFIL3 was required in the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), and was essential for the differentiation of αLP, a bone marrow cell population that gives rise to all known ILC lineages. Clonal differentiation studies revealed that CXCR6<sup>+</sup> cells within the αLP population differentiate into all ILC lineages but not T- and B-cells. We further show that NFIL3 governs ILC development by directly regulating expression of the transcription factor TOX. These findings establish that NFIL3 directs the differentiation of a committed ILC precursor that gives rise to all ILC lineages and provide insight into the defining role of NFIL3 in ILC development.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04406"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04406"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04406","entryfile":"elife-04406-v2.xml","files":["elife-04406-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04406-v1.xml"]}
