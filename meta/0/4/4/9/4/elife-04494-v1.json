Patients with mutations in <italic>HOIL1</italic> (<italic>RBCK1</italic>) present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency. We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation. However, they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> or <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>. Increased susceptibility to <italic>Listeria</italic> was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines. In contrast, HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> or murine Î³-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68), and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype. Surprisingly, chronic infection with MHV68 complemented the immunodeficiency of HOIL-1, IL-6, Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice following <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice, highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04494"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04494"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"01","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04494","entryfile":"elife-04494-v1.xml","files":["elife-04494-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04494-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
