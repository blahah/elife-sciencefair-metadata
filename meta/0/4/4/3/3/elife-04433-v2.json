In this study, we show that MHC-II expression on lymph node stromal cells is additionally required for homeostatic maintenance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and maintenance of immune quiescence. In the absence of MHC-II expression in lymph node transplants, i.e. on lymph node stromal cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells became activated, ultimately resulting in transplant rejection. MHC-II self-antigen presentation by lymph node stromal cells allowed the non-proliferative maintenance of antigen-specific Tregs and constrained antigen-specific immunity. Altogether, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which lymph node stromal cells regulate peripheral immunity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04433"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04433"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04433","entryfile":"elife-04433-v2.xml","files":["elife-04433-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04433-v1.xml"]}
