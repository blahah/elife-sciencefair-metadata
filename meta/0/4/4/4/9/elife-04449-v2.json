We have identified a conserved protein and interactors required for maintaining cell adhesion during a simple collective migration in the developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> male gonad. LINKIN is a previously uncharacterized, transmembrane protein conserved throughout Metazoa. We identified seven atypical FG–GAP domains in the extracellular domain, which potentially folds into a β-propeller structure resembling the α-integrin ligand-binding domain. <italic>C. elegans</italic> LNKN-1 localizes to the plasma membrane of all gonadal cells, with apical and lateral bias. We identified the LINKIN interactors RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and α-tubulin by using SILAC mass spectrometry on human HEK 293T cells and testing candidates for <italic>lnkn-1</italic>-like function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> male gonad. We propose that LINKIN promotes adhesion between neighboring cells through its extracellular domain and regulates microtubule dynamics through RUVBL proteins at its intracellular domain.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04449"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04449"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04449","entryfile":"elife-04449-v2.xml","files":["elife-04449-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-04449-v1.xml"]}
