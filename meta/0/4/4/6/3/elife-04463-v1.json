A recent NMR study was unable to detect the <italic>trans</italic> clamping interaction of complexin and therefore questioned the previous interpretation of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer and isothermal titration calorimetry data on which the <italic>trans</italic> clamping model was originally based. Here we present new biochemical data that underscore the validity of our previous interpretation and the continued relevancy of the <italic>trans</italic> insertion model for complexin clamping.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"04463"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.04463"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"04463","entryfile":"elife-04463-v1.xml","files":["elife-04463-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04463-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04463-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04463-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-04463-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
