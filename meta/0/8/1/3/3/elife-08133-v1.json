Here, using a pancreatic islet allograft model and CD3 antibody therapy, we showed, by single cell gene profiling, that intragraft CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes coexpressing granzyme B and perforin were selectively depleted through the Fas/FasL pathway. This step led to long-standing anergy of the remaining CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells marked by the absence of cytotoxic/inflammatory gene expression also confirmed by transcriptome analysis. This sustained unresponsiveness required the presence of the alloantigens. Furthermore, tissue-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes produced TGFβ and expressed the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and PD-L1. Blockade of TGFβ downregulated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression and precipitated graft rejection. Neutralizing PD-1, PD-L1 or TGFβRII signaling in T cells also abrogated CD3 antibody-induced tolerance. These studies unravel novel mechanisms underlying CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell anergy and reveal a cell intrinsic regulatory link between the TGFβ and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08133"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08133"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08133","entryfile":"elife-08133-v1.xml","files":["elife-08133-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08133-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
