To find recognition proteins involved in lamination, we utilized microarray data from 13 subtypes to identify differentially-expressed extracellular proteins and performed a high-throughput biochemical screen. We identified ~50 previously-unknown receptor-ligand pairs, including new interactions among members of the FLRT and Unc5 families. These proteins show laminar-restricted IPL localization and induce attraction and/or repulsion of retinal neurites in culture, placing them in an ideal position to mediate laminar targeting. Consistent with a repulsive role in arbor lamination, we observed complementary expression patterns for one interaction pair, FLRT2-Unc5C, <italic>in vivo</italic>. Starburst amacrine cells and their synaptic partners, ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells, express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C. These data suggest a single molecular mechanism may have been co-opted by synaptic partners to ensure joint laminar restriction.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08149"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08149"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08149","entryfile":"elife-08149-v3.xml","files":["elife-08149-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08149-v1.xml","elife-08149-v2.xml"]}
