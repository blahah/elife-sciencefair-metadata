{"title":"Conformational change of Dishevelled plays a key regulatory role in the Wnt signaling pathways","author":[{"surname":"Lee","given-names":"Ho-Jin"},{"surname":"Shi","given-names":"De-Li"},{"surname":"Zheng","given-names":"Jie J"}],"abstract":"The intracellular signaling molecule Dishevelled (Dvl) mediates canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling via its PDZ domain. Different pathways diverge at this point by a mechanism that remains unclear. Here we show that the peptide-binding pocket of the Dvl PDZ domain can be occupied by Dvl's own highly conserved C-terminus, inducing a closed conformation. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, Wnt-regulated convergent extension (CE) is readily affected by Dvl mutants unable to form the closed conformation than by wild-type Dvl. We also demonstrate that while Dvl cooperates with other Wnt pathway elements to activate canonical Wnt signaling, the open conformation of Dvl more effectively activates Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest that together with other players in the Wnt signaling pathway, the conformational change of Dvl regulates Wnt stimulated JNK activity in the non-canonical Wnt signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08142"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08142"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08142","entryfile":"elife-08142-v2.xml","files":["elife-08142-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08142-v1.xml"]}
