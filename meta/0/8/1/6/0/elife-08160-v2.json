{"title":"The vacuole/lysosome is required for cell-cycle progression","author":[{"surname":"Jin","given-names":"Yui"},{"surname":"Weisman","given-names":"Lois S"}],"abstract":"Organelles are distributed to daughter cells, via inheritance pathways. However, it is unclear whether there are mechanisms beyond inheritance, which ensure that organelles are present in all cells. Here we present the unexpected finding that the yeast vacuole plays a positive essential role in initiation of the cell-cycle. When inheritance fails, a new vacuole is generated. We show that this occurs prior to the next cell-cycle, and gain insight into this alternative pathway. Moreover, we find that a combination of a defect in inheritance with an acute block in the vacuole biogenesis results in the loss of a functional vacuole and a specific arrest of cells in early G1 phase. Furthermore, this role for the vacuole in cell-cycle progression requires an intact TORC1-<italic>SCH9</italic> pathway that can only signal from a mature vacuole. These mechanisms may serve as a checkpoint for the presence of the vacuole/lysosome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08160"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08160"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08160","entryfile":"elife-08160-v2.xml","files":["elife-08160-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08160-v1.xml"]}
