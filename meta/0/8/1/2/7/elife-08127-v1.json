{"title":"The number of olfactory stimuli that humans can discriminate is still unknown","author":[{"surname":"Gerkin","given-names":"Richard C"},{"surname":"Castro","given-names":"Jason B"}],"abstract":"It was recently proposed (<xref>Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) that humans can discriminate between <italic>at least</italic> a trillion olfactory stimuli. Here we show that this claim is the result of a fragile estimation framework capable of producing nearly any result from the reported data, including values tens of orders of magnitude larger or smaller than the one originally reported in (<xref>Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the formula used to derive this estimate is well-known to provide an upper bound, not a lower bound as reported. That is to say, the actual claim supported by the calculation is in fact that humans can discriminate <italic>at most</italic> one trillion olfactory stimuli. We conclude that there is no evidence for the original claim.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08127"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08127"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08127","entryfile":"elife-08127-v1.xml","files":["elife-08127-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08127-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
