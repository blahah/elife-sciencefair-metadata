Their maturation requires the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery. To identify new CIA proteins we employed systematic protein interaction approaches and discovered the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1 as binding partners of the CIA targeting complex. Depletion of Yae1 or Lto1 results in defective Fe-S maturation of the ribosome-associated ABC protein Rli1, but surprisingly no other tested targets. Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1 in a chain of binding events. Lto1 uses its conserved C-terminal tryptophan for binding the CIA targeting complex, the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs in both Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate their complex formation, and Yae1 recruits Rli1. Human YAE1D1 and the cancer-related ORAOV1 can replace their yeast counterparts demonstrating evolutionary conservation. Collectively, the Yae1-Lto1 complex functions as a target-specific adaptor that recruits apo-Rli1 to the generic CIA machinery.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08231"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08231"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08231","entryfile":"elife-08231-v2.xml","files":["elife-08231-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08231-v1.xml"]}
