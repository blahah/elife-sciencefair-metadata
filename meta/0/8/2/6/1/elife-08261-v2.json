However, in vivo screens have not attained throughput capacities possible with in vitro assays. We therefore developed a method enabling in vivo high-throughput screening (HTS) in zebrafish, termed <underline>a</underline>utomated <underline>r</underline>eporter <underline>q</underline>uantification <underline>i</underline>n <underline>v</underline>ivo (ARQiv). In this study, ARQiv was combined with robotics to fully actualize whole-organism HTS (ARQiv-HTS). In a primary screen, this platform quantified cell-specific fluorescent reporters in >500,000 transgenic zebrafish larvae to identify FDA-approved (Federal Drug Administration) drugs that increased the number of insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas. 24 drugs were confirmed as inducers of endocrine differentiation and/or stimulators of β-cell proliferation. Further, we discovered novel roles for NF-κB signaling in regulating endocrine differentiation and for serotonergic signaling in selectively stimulating β-cell proliferation. These studies demonstrate the power of ARQiv-HTS for drug discovery and provide unique insights into signaling pathways controlling β-cell mass, potential therapeutic targets for treating diabetes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08261"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08261"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08261","entryfile":"elife-08261-v2.xml","files":["elife-08261-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08261-v1.xml"]}
