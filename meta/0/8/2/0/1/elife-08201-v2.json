While the Hippo signaling pathway plays a major role in organ growth control, how it senses and responds to increased cell density is still unclear. In this study, we use the zebrafish lateral line primordium (LLP), a group of migrating epithelial cells that form sensory organs, to understand how tissue growth is controlled during organ formation. Loss of the cell junction-associated Motin protein Amotl2a leads to overproliferation and bigger LLP, affecting the final pattern of sensory organs. Amotl2a function in the LLP is mediated together by the Hippo pathway effector Yap1 and the Wnt/β-catenin effector Lef1. Our results implicate for the first time the Hippo pathway in size regulation in the LL system. We further provide evidence that the Hippo/Motin interaction is essential to limit tissue size during development.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08201"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08201"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08201","entryfile":"elife-08201-v2.xml","files":["elife-08201-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08201-v1.xml"]}
