In most organisms only a fraction of DSBs become crossovers. Here we report a novel meiotic gene, v<italic>ilya</italic>, which encodes a protein with homology to Zip3-like proteins shown to determine DSB fate in other organisms. Vilya is required for meiotic DSB formation, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with the DSB accessory protein Mei-P22, and localizes to those DSB sites that will mature into crossovers. In early pachytene Vilya localizes along the central region of the synaptonemal complex and to discrete foci. The accumulation of Vilya at foci is dependent on DSB formation. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that Vilya is a component of recombination nodules, which mark the sites of crossover formation. Thus Vilya links the mechanism of DSB formation to either the selection of those DSBs that will become crossovers or to the actual process of crossing over.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08287"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08287"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08287","entryfile":"elife-08287-v2.xml","files":["elife-08287-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08287-v1.xml"]}
