To investigate how Csk activity regulates T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, we utilized a mouse expressing mutated Csk (Csk<sup>AS</sup>) whose catalytic activity is specifically and rapidly inhibited by a small molecule. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> during TCR stimulation led to stronger and more prolonged TCR signaling and to increased proliferation. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> enhanced activation by weak but strictly cognate agonists. Titration of Csk inhibition revealed that a very small increase in SFK activity was sufficient to potentiate T cell responses to weak agonists. Csk plays an important role, not only in basal signaling, but also in setting the TCR signaling threshold and affinity recognition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08088"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08088"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08088","entryfile":"elife-08088-v2.xml","files":["elife-08088-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08088-v1.xml"]}
