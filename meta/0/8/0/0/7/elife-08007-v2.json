AGS is thought to arise from the accumulation of incompletely metabolized endogenous nucleic acid species owing to mutations in nucleic acid-degrading enzymes TREX1 (AGS1), RNase H2 (AGS2, 3 and 4), and SAMHD1 (AGS5). However, the identity and source of such immunogenic nucleic acid species remain undefined. Using genome-wide approaches, we show that fibroblasts from AGS patients with AGS1-5 mutations are burdened by excessive loads of RNA:DNA hybrids. Using MethylC-seq, we show that AGS fibroblasts display pronounced and global loss of DNA methylation and demonstrate that AGS-specific RNA:DNA hybrids often occur within DNA hypomethylated regions. Altogether, our data suggest that RNA:DNA hybrids may represent a common immunogenic form of nucleic acids in AGS and provide the first evidence of epigenetic perturbations in AGS, furthering the links between AGS and SLE.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08007"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08007"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08007","entryfile":"elife-08007-v2.xml","files":["elife-08007-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08007-v1.xml"]}
