It is less well understood, however, to what extent entire neural circuits of different individuals are similar. Previously, we reported the neuronal connectome of the visual eye circuit from the head of a <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> larva (<xref>Randel et al., 2014</xref>). We now report a full-body serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) dataset of another larva of the same age, for which we describe the connectome of the visual eyes and the larval eyespots. Anatomical comparisons and quantitative analyses of the two circuits reveal a high inter-individual stereotypy of the cell complement, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity, including the left-right asymmetry in the connectivity of some neurons. Our work shows the extent to which the eye circuitry in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae is hard-wired.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08069"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08069"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08069","entryfile":"elife-08069-v2.xml","files":["elife-08069-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08069-v1.xml"]}
