How these immune receptors detect effectors remains poorly understood. Here we describe the structural basis for direct recognition of AVR-Pik, an effector from the rice blast pathogen, by the rice intracellular NLR immune receptor Pik. AVR-PikD binds a dimer of the Pikp-1 HMA integrated domain with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex enabled design of mutations to alter protein interaction in yeast and in vitro, and perturb effector-mediated response both in a rice cultivar containing Pikp and upon expression of AVR-PikD and Pikp in the model plant <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. These data reveal the molecular details of a recognition event, mediated by a novel integrated domain in an NLR, which initiates a plant immune response and resistance to rice blast disease. Such studies underpin novel opportunities for engineering disease resistance to plant pathogens in staple food crops.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08709"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08709"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08709","entryfile":"elife-08709-v1.xml","files":["elife-08709-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08709-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
