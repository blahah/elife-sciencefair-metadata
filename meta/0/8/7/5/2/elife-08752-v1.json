{"title":"Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex moderate stress induced depressive behaviors","author":[{"surname":"Shrestha","given-names":"Prerana"},{"surname":"Mousa","given-names":"Awni"},{"surname":"Heintz","given-names":"Nathaniel"}],"abstract":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent illness that can be precipitated by acute or chronic stress. Studies of patients with Wolfram syndrome and carriers have identified <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutations as causative for MDD. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be involved in depression and behavioral resilience, although the cell types and circuits in the mPFC that moderate depressive behaviors in response to stress have not been determined. Here, we report that deletion of <italic>Wfs1</italic> from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells impairs the ability of the mPFC to suppress stress-induced depressive behaviors, and results in hyperactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and altered accumulation of important growth and neurotrophic factors. Our data identify superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells as critical for moderation of stress in the context of depressive behaviors and suggest that dysfunction in these cells may contribute to the clinical relationship between stress and depression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08752"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08752"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08752","entryfile":"elife-08752-v1.xml","files":["elife-08752-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08752-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08752-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08752-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08752-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08752-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08752-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08752-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
