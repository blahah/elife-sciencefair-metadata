{"title":"Genomic epidemiology of artemisinin resistant malaria","author":[],"abstract":"The current epidemic of artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia is the result of a soft selective sweep involving at least 20 independent <italic>kelch13</italic> mutations. In a large global survey, we find that <italic>kelch13</italic> mutations which cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We show that African <italic>kelch13</italic> mutations have originated locally, and that <italic>kelch13</italic> shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa, whereas in Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations, many of which cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus, <italic>kelch13</italic> is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa, despite a deep reservoir of variations that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on <italic>kelch13</italic> data alone, and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions, shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08714"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08714"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"08714","entryfile":"elife-08714-v2.xml","files":["elife-08714-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08714-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08714-v1.xml"]}
