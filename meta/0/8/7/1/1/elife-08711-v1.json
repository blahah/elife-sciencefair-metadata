Using a <italic>Trp53</italic>-deficient mouse model of GBM, we show that genetic inactivation of the Atm cofactor Atmin, which is dispensable for embryonic and adult neural development, strongly suppresses GBM formation. Mechanistically, expression of several GBM-associated genes, including <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, was normalized by <italic>Atmin</italic> deletion in the <italic>Trp53</italic>-null background. Pharmacological ATM inhibition also reduced <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression, and reduced the proliferation of <italic>Trp53</italic>-deficient primary glioma cells from murine and human tumors, while normal neural stem cells were unaffected. Analysis of GBM datasets showed that <italic>PDGFRA</italic> expression is also significantly increased in human <italic>TP53</italic>-mutant compared with <italic>TP53</italic>-wild-type tumors. Moreover, combined treatment with ATM and PDGFRA inhibitors efficiently killed <italic>TP53</italic>-mutant primary human GBM cells, but not untransformed neural stem cells. These results reveal a new requirement for ATMIN-dependent ATM signaling in TP53-deficient GBM, indicating a pro-tumorigenic role for ATM in the context of these tumors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08711"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08711"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08711","entryfile":"elife-08711-v1.xml","files":["elife-08711-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig6-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08711-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
