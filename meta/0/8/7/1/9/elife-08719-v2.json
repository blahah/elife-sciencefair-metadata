Structural information on two-thirds of the complex has been limited to coarse subunit mapping onto 2-D images from electron micrographs. We have performed chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, and combined the results with information from X-ray crystallography, homology modeling, and cryo-electron microscopy by an integrative modeling approach to determine a 3-D model of the entire Mediator complex. The approach is validated by the use of X-ray crystal structures as internal controls and by consistency with previous results from electron microscopy and yeast two-hybrid screens. The model shows the locations and orientations of all Mediator subunits, as well as subunit interfaces and some secondary structural elements. Segments of 20–40 amino acid residues are placed with an average precision of 20 Å. The model reveals roles of individual subunits in the organization of the complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08719"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08719"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08719","entryfile":"elife-08719-v2.xml","files":["elife-08719-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08719-v1.xml"]}
