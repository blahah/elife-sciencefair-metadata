Here we show using murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS), that pain induces EAE relapse. Mechanistic analysis showed that pain induction activates a sensory-sympathetic signal followed by a chemokine-mediated accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells that showed antigen-presentation activity at specific ventral vessels in the fifth lumbar cord of EAE-recovered mice. Following this accumulation, various immune cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells recruited in the spinal cord in a manner dependent on a local chemokine inducer in endothelial cells, resulting in EAE relapse. Our results demonstrate that a pain-mediated neural signal can be transformed into an inflammation reaction at specific vessels to induce disease relapse, thus making this signal a potential therapeutic target.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08733"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08733"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08733","entryfile":"elife-08733-v2.xml","files":["elife-08733-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08733-v1.xml"]}
