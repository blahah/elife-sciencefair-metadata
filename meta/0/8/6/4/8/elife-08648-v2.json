Unexpectedly, Marfan mice treated with CCBs show accelerated aneurysm expansion, rupture, and premature lethality. This effect is both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) dependent and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) dependent. We have identified protein kinase C beta (PKCβ) as a critical mediator of this pathway and demonstrate that the PKCβ inhibitor enzastaurin, and the clinically available anti-hypertensive agent hydralazine, both normalize aortic growth in Marfan mice, in association with reduced PKCβ and ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore, patients with Marfan syndrome and other forms of inherited thoracic aortic aneurysm taking CCBs display increased risk of aortic dissection and need for aortic surgery, compared to patients on other antihypertensive agents.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08648"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08648"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"08648","entryfile":"elife-08648-v2.xml","files":["elife-08648-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08648-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08648-v1.xml"]}
