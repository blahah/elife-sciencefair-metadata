In this study, we identify <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> NOCA-1 as a protein with homology to vertebrate ninein. NOCA-1 contributes to the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in multiple tissues. In the larval epidermis, NOCA-1 functions redundantly with the minus end protection factor Patronin/PTRN-1 to assemble a circumferential microtubule array essential for worm growth and morphogenesis. Controlled degradation of a γ-tubulin complex subunit in this tissue revealed that γ-tubulin acts with NOCA-1 in parallel to Patronin/PTRN-1. In the germline, NOCA-1 and γ-tubulin co-localize at the cell surface, and inhibiting either leads to a microtubule assembly defect. γ-tubulin targets independently of NOCA-1, but NOCA-1 targeting requires γ-tubulin when a non-essential putatively palmitoylated cysteine is mutated. These results show that NOCA-1 acts with γ-tubulin to assemble non-centrosomal arrays in multiple tissues and highlight functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin protein families.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08649"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08649"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08649","entryfile":"elife-08649-v2.xml","files":["elife-08649-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08649-v1.xml"]}
