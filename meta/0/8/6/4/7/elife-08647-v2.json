However, the precise molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that KPNB1, an importin β component of the ncRNA repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NRON) ribonucleoprotein complex, mediates nuclear translocation and repressor function of the PER/CRY complex. RNAi depletion of KPNB1 traps the PER/CRY complex in the cytoplasm by blocking nuclear entry of PER proteins in human cells. KPNB1 interacts mainly with PER proteins and directs PER/CRY nuclear transport in a circadian fashion. Interestingly, KPNB1 regulates the PER/CRY nuclear entry and repressor function, independently of importin α, its classical partner. Moreover, inducible inhibition of the conserved <italic>Drosophila</italic> importin β in lateral neurons abolishes behavioral rhythms in flies. Collectively, these data show that KPNB1 is required for timely nuclear import of PER/CRY in the negative feedback regulation of the circadian clock.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08647"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08647"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08647","entryfile":"elife-08647-v2.xml","files":["elife-08647-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08647-v1.xml"]}
