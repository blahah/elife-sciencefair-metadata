Yet, how the lengths of actin-based stereocilia are regulated remains poorly understood. Mutations of the molecular motor myosin 15 stunt stereocilia growth and cause deafness. We found that hair cells express two isoforms of myosin 15 that differ by inclusion of an 133-kDa N-terminal domain, and that these isoforms can selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows. Using an isoform-specific knockout mouse, we show that hair cells expressing only the small isoform remarkably develop normal stereocilia bundles. However, a critical subset of stereocilia with active mechanotransducer channels subsequently retracts. The larger isoform with the 133-kDa N-terminal domain traffics to these specialized stereocilia and prevents disassembly of their actin core. Our results show that myosin 15 isoforms can navigate between functionally distinct classes of stereocilia, and are independently required to assemble and then maintain the intricate hair bundle architecture.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08627"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08627"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"08627","entryfile":"elife-08627-v2.xml","files":["elife-08627-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08627-v1.xml"]}
