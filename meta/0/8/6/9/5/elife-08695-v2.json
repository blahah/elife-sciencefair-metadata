In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> the signaling protein Exchange Factor for ARF-6 (EFA-6) is a potent intrinsic inhibitor of axon regrowth. Here we show that axon injury triggers rapid EFA-6-dependent inhibition of axonal microtubule (MT) dynamics, concomitant with relocalization of EFA-6. EFA-6 relocalization and axon regrowth inhibition require a conserved 18-aa motif in its otherwise intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. The EFA-6 N-terminus binds the MT-associated proteins TAC-1/Transforming-Acidic-Coiled-Coil, and ZYG-8/Doublecortin-Like-Kinase, both of which are required for regenerative growth cone formation, and which act downstream of EFA-6. After injury TAC-1 and EFA-6 transiently relocalize to sites marked by the MT minus end binding protein PTRN-1/Patronin. We propose that EFA-6 acts as a bifunctional injury-responsive regulator of axonal MT dynamics, acting at the cell cortex in the steady state and at MT minus ends after injury.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08695"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08695"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08695","entryfile":"elife-08695-v2.xml","files":["elife-08695-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08695-v1.xml"]}
