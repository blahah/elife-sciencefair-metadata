Yet few signaling pathways have been identified to be unique solely to Tfh development. ROQUIN is a post-transcriptional repressor of T cells, acting through its ROQ domain to destabilize mRNA targets important for Th1, Th17, and Tfh biology. Here, we report that ROQUIN has a paradoxical function on Tfh differentiation mediated by its RING domain: mice with a T cell-specific deletion of the ROQUIN RING domain have unchanged Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tregs during a T-dependent response but show a profoundly defective antigen-specific Tfh compartment. ROQUIN RING signaling directly antagonized the catalytic α1 subunit of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central stress-responsive regulator of cellular metabolism and mTOR signaling, which is known to facilitate T-dependent humoral immunity. We therefore unexpectedly uncover a ROQUIN–AMPK metabolic signaling nexus essential for selectively promoting Tfh responses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08698"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08698"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08698","entryfile":"elife-08698-v2.xml","files":["elife-08698-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08698-v1.xml"]}
