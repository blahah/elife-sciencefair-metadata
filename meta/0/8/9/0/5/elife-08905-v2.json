Less frequent mutations in Ras are poorly characterized for their oncogenic potential. Yet insight into their mechanism of action may point to novel opportunities to target Ras. Here, we show that several cancer-associated mutations in the switch III region moderately increase Ras activity in all isoforms. Mutants are biochemically inconspicuous, while their clustering into nanoscale signaling complexes on the plasma membrane, termed nanocluster, is augmented. Nanoclustering dictates downstream effector recruitment, MAPK-activity, and tumorigenic cell proliferation. Our results describe an unprecedented mechanism of signaling protein activation in cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08905"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08905"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08905","entryfile":"elife-08905-v2.xml","files":["elife-08905-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08905-v1.xml"]}
