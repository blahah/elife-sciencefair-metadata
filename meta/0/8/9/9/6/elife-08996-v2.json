{"title":"An oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α isoform inhibits Wnt signaling by destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex","author":[{"surname":"Zhang","given-names":"Peng"},{"surname":"Bai","given-names":"Yan"},{"surname":"Lu","given-names":"Ling"},{"surname":"Li","given-names":"Yun"},{"surname":"Duan","given-names":"Cunming"}],"abstract":"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), while best known for their roles in the hypoxic response, have oxygen-independent roles in early development with poorly defined mechanisms. Here, we report a novel Hif-3α variant, Hif-3α2, in zebrafish. Hif-3α2 lacks the bHLH, PAS, PAC, and ODD domains, and is expressed in embryonic and adult tissues independently of oxygen availability. Hif-3α2 is a nuclear protein with significant hypoxia response element (HRE)-dependent transcriptional activity. Hif-3α2 overexpression not only decreases embryonic growth and developmental timing but also causes left-right asymmetry defects. Genetic deletion of Hif-3α2 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing increases, while Hif-3α2 overexpression decreases, Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, Hif-3α2 binds to β-catenin and destabilizes the nuclear β-catenin complex. This mechanism is distinct from GSK3β-mediated β-catenin degradation and is conserved in humans. These findings provide new insights into the oxygen-independent actions of HIFs and uncover a novel mechanism regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08996"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08996"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08996","entryfile":"elife-08996-v2.xml","files":["elife-08996-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig10-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08996-v1.xml"]}
