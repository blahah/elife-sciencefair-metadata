{"title":"The evolution of non-reproductive workers in insect colonies with haplodiploid genetics","author":[{"surname":"Olejarz","given-names":"Jason W"},{"surname":"Allen","given-names":"Benjamin"},{"surname":"Veller","given-names":"Carl"},{"surname":"Nowak","given-names":"Martin A"}],"abstract":"Eusociality is a distinct form of biological organization. A key characteristic of advanced eusociality is the presence of non-reproductive workers. Why evolution should produce organisms that sacrifice their own reproductive potential in order to aid others is an important question in evolutionary biology. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the selective forces that determine the emergence and stability of non-reproductive workers. We study the effects, in situations where the queen of the colony has mated once or several times, of recessive and dominant sterility alleles acting in her offspring. Contrary to widespread belief based on heuristic arguments of genetic relatedness, non-reproductive workers can easily evolve in polyandrous species. The crucial quantity is the functional relationship between a colonyâ€™s reproductive rate and the fraction of non-reproductive workers present in that colony. We derive precise conditions for natural selection to favor the evolution of non-reproductive workers.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08918"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08918"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08918","entryfile":"elife-08918-v2.xml","files":["elife-08918-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08918-v1.xml"]}
