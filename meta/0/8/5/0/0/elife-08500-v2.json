We investigated whether a parental cancer diagnosis is associated with a higher-than-expected risk of injury among children by using a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study. Compared to children without parental cancer, children with parental cancer had a higher rate of hospital contact for injury during the first year after parental cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-1.33), especially when the parent had a comorbid psychiatric disorder after cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.08-1.85). The rate increment declined during the second and third year after parental cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07-1.14) and became null afterwards (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99-1.03). Children with parental cancer also had a higher rate of repeated injuries than the other children (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.12-1.15). Given the high rate of injury among children in the general population, our findings may have important public health implications.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08500"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08500"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08500","entryfile":"elife-08500-v2.xml","files":["elife-08500-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08500-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08500-v1.xml"]}
