{"title":"Salt-inducible kinases mediate nutrient-sensing to link dietary sugar and tumorigenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Hirabayashi","given-names":"Susumu"},{"surname":"Cagan","given-names":"Ross L"}],"abstract":"Cancer cells demand excessive nutrients to support their proliferation but how cancer cells sense and promote growth in the nutrient favorable conditions remain incompletely understood. Epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity is a risk factor for various types of cancers. Feeding <italic>Drosophila</italic> a high dietary sugar was previously demonstrated to not only direct metabolic defects including obesity and organismal insulin resistance, but also transform Ras/Src-activated cells into aggressive tumors. Here we demonstrate that Ras/Src-activated cells are sensitive to perturbations in the Hippo signaling pathway. We provide evidence that nutritional cues activate Salt-inducible kinase, leading to Hippo pathway downregulation in Ras/Src-activated cells. The result is Yorkie-dependent increase in Wingless signaling, a key mediator that promotes diet-enhanced Ras/Src-tumorigenesis in an otherwise insulin-resistant environment. Through this mechanism, Ras/Src-activated cells are positioned to efficiently respond to nutritional signals and ensure tumor growth upon nutrient rich condition including obesity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08501"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08501"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08501","entryfile":"elife-08501-v1.xml","files":["elife-08501-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08501-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08501-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08501-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08501-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08501-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08501-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08501-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
