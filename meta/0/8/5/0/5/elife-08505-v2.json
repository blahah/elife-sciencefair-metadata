CarD, an essential activator in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, is found in many bacteria, including <italic>Thermus</italic> species, but absent in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. To delineate the molecular mechanism of CarD, we determined crystal structures of <italic>Thermus</italic> transcription initiation complexes containing CarD. The structures show CarD interacts with the unique DNA topology presented by the upstream double-stranded/single-stranded DNA junction of the transcription bubble. We confirm that our structures correspond to functional activation complexes, and extend our understanding of the role of a conserved CarD Trp residue that serves as a minor groove wedge, preventing collapse of the transcription bubble to stabilize the transcription initiation complex. Unlike <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP, many bacterial RNAPs form unstable promoter complexes, explaining the need for CarD.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08505"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08505"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08505","entryfile":"elife-08505-v2.xml","files":["elife-08505-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08505-v1.xml"]}
