Five conserved tubulin cofactors/chaperones and the Arl2 GTPase regulate α- and β-tubulin assembly into heterodimers and maintain the soluble tubulin pool in the cytoplasm, but their physical mechanisms are unknown. Here, we reconstitute a core tubulin chaperone consisting of tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2, and reveal a cage-like structure for regulating αβ-tubulin. Biochemical assays and electron microscopy structures of multiple intermediates show the sequential binding of αβ-tubulin dimer followed by tubulin cofactor TBCC onto this chaperone, forming a ternary complex in which Arl2 GTP hydrolysis is activated to alter αβ-tubulin conformation. A GTP-state locked Arl2 mutant inhibits ternary complex dissociation in vitro and causes severe defects in microtubule dynamics in vivo. Our studies suggest a revised paradigm for tubulin cofactors and Arl2 functions as a catalytic chaperone that regulates soluble αβ-tubulin assembly and maintenance to support microtubule dynamics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08811"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08811"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08811","entryfile":"elife-08811-v2.xml","files":["elife-08811-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08811-v1.xml"]}
