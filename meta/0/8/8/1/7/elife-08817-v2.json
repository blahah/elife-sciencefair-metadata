However, little is known about when and how individual endothelial cell (EC) responds to angiogenic inputs in vivo. Here, we visualized endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in zebrafish and found that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in ECs exhibiting angiogenic behavior. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations depended upon VEGF receptor-2 (Vegfr2) and Vegfr3 in ECs budding from the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein, respectively. Thus, visualizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations allowed us to monitor EC responses to angiogenic cues. Vegfr-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in migrating tip cells as well as stalk cells budding from the DA. We investigated how Dll4/Notch signaling regulates endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and found that it was required for the selection of single stalk cell as well as tip cell. Thus, we captured spatio-temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during sprouting angiogenesis, as a result of cellular responses to angiogenic inputs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08817"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08817"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08817","entryfile":"elife-08817-v2.xml","files":["elife-08817-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig9-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08817-v1.xml"]}
