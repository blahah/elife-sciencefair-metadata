It is exclusively produced by renal epithelial cells and it plays key roles in kidney function and disease. Uromodulin mainly exerts its function as an extracellular matrix whose assembly depends on a conserved, specific proteolytic cleavage leading to conformational activation of a Zona Pellucida (ZP) polymerisation domain. Through a comprehensive approach, including extensive characterisation of uromodulin processing in cellular models and in specific knock-out mice, we demonstrate that the membrane-bound serine protease hepsin is the enzyme responsible for the physiological cleavage of uromodulin. Our findings define a key aspect of uromodulin biology and identify the first <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate of hepsin. The identification of hepsin as the first protease involved in the release of a ZP domain protein is likely relevant for other members of this protein family, including several extracellular proteins, as egg coat proteins and inner ear tectorins.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08887"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08887"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08887","entryfile":"elife-08887-v2.xml","files":["elife-08887-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08887-v1.xml"]}
