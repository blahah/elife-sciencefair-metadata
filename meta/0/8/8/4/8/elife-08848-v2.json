Yet the identity and function of these maternal factors during the gamete to embryo transition remains poorly understood. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, LSD1/KDM1A enables this transition by removing H3K4me2 and preventing the transgenerational inheritance of transcription patterns. Here we show that loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A in mice results in embryonic arrest at the 1-2 cell stage, with arrested embryos failing to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition. This suggests that LSD1/KDM1A maternal reprogramming is conserved. Moreover, partial loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A results in striking phenotypes weeks after fertilization; including perinatal lethality and abnormal behavior in surviving adults. These maternal effect hypomorphic phenotypes are associated with alterations in DNA methylation and expression at imprinted genes. These results establish a novel mammalian paradigm where defects in early epigenetic reprogramming can lead to defects that manifest later in development.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08848"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08848"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"08848","entryfile":"elife-08848-v2.xml","files":["elife-08848-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08848-v1.xml"]}
