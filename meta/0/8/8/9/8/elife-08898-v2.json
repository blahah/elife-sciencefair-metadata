{"title":"The RhoGAP activity of CYK-4/MgcRacGAP functions non-canonically by promoting RhoA activation during cytokinesis","author":[{"surname":"Zhang","given-names":"Donglei"},{"surname":"Glotzer","given-names":"Michael"}],"abstract":"Cytokinesis requires activation of the GTPase RhoA. ECT-2, the exchange factor responsible for RhoA activation, is regulated to ensure spatiotemporal control of contractile ring assembly. Centralspindlin, composed of the Rho family GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 and the kinesin MKLP1/ZEN-4, is known to activate ECT-2, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. We report that ECT-2-mediated RhoA activation depends on the ability of CYK-4 to localize to the plasma membrane, bind RhoA, and promote GTP hydrolysis by RhoA. Defects resulting from loss of CYK-4 RhoGAP activity can be rescued by activating mutations in ECT-2 or depletion of RGA-3/4, which functions as a conventional RhoGAP for RhoA. Consistent with CYK-4 RhoGAP activity contributing to GEF activation, the catalytic domains of CYK-4 and ECT-2 directly interact. Thus, counterintuitively, CYK-4 RhoGAP activity promotes RhoA activation. We propose that the most active form of the cytokinetic RhoGEF involves complex formation between ECT-2, centralspindlin and RhoA.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08898"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08898"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08898","entryfile":"elife-08898-v2.xml","files":["elife-08898-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08898-v1.xml"]}
