However, whether longevity mechanisms counteract the effects of aging continually throughout life, or whether they act during specific periods of life, preventing changes that precede mortality is unclear. Here, we uncover <italic>transcriptional drift</italic>, a phenomenon that describes how aging causes genes within functional groups to change expression in opposing directions. These changes cause a transcriptome-wide loss in mRNA stoichiometry and loss of co-expression patterns in aging animals, as compared to young adults. Using <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as a model, we show that extending lifespan by inhibiting serotonergic signals by the antidepressant mianserin attenuates transcriptional drift, allowing the preservation of a younger transcriptome into an older age. Our data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of serotonergic signals slows age-dependent physiological decline and the associated rise in mortality levels exclusively in young adults, thereby postponing the onset of major mortality.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08833"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08833"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08833","entryfile":"elife-08833-v2.xml","files":["elife-08833-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08833-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08833-v1.xml"]}
