We found that <italic>Yap</italic>, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is specifically expressed in these stem cells. <italic>Yap</italic> knock-down leads to an accelerated S-phase and an abnormal progression of DNA replication, a phenotype likely mediated by upregulation of <italic>c-Myc</italic>. This is associated with an increased occurrence of DNA damage and eventually p53-p21 pathway-mediated cell death. Finally, we identified PKNOX1, a transcription factor involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, as a functional and physical interactant of YAP. Altogether, we propose that YAP is required in adult retinal stem cells to regulate the temporal firing of replication origins and quality control of replicated DNA. Our data reinforce the view that specific mechanisms dedicated to S-phase control are at work in stem cells to protect them from genomic instability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08488"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08488"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08488","entryfile":"elife-08488-v1.xml","files":["elife-08488-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08488-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
