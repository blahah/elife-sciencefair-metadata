The mother centriole recruits and organises the PCM and templates the formation of the daughter centriole. It has been reported that several important <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCM-organising proteins are recruited to centrioles from the cytosol as part of large cytoplasmic ‘S-CAP’ complexes that contain the centriole protein Sas-4. In a previous paper (<xref>Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>) we showed that one of these proteins, Cnn, and another key PCM-organising protein, Spd-2, are recruited around the mother centriole before spreading outwards to form a scaffold that supports mitotic PCM assembly; the recruitment of Cnn and Spd-2 is dependent on another S-CAP protein, Asl. We show here, however, that Cnn, Spd-2 and Asl are not recruited to the mother centriole as part of a complex with Sas-4. Thus, PCM recruitment in fly embryos does not appear to require cytosolic S-CAP complexes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08483"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08483"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08483","entryfile":"elife-08483-v1.xml","files":["elife-08483-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08483-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08483-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08483-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08483-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
