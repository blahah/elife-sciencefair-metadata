Natural killer (NK) cells become activated when the receptor NKG2D is engaged by ligands that are frequently upregulated in primary tumors and on cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms driving NKG2D ligand expression on tumor cells are not well defined. Using a forward genetic screen in a tumor-derived human cell line, we identified several novel factors supporting expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP1. Our results show stepwise contributions of independent pathways working at multiple stages of ULBP1 biogenesis. Deeper investigation of selected hits from the screen showed that the transcription factor ATF4 drives <italic>ULBP1</italic> gene expression in cancer cell lines, while the RNA-binding protein RBM4 supports ULBP1 expression by suppressing a novel alternatively spliced isoform of <italic>ULBP1</italic> mRNA. These findings offer insight into the stress pathways that alert the immune system to danger.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08474"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08474"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"08474","entryfile":"elife-08474-v1.xml","files":["elife-08474-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-08474-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
