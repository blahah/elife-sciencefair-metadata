{"title":"Rapid learning in visual cortical networks","author":[{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Ye"},{"surname":"Dragoi","given-names":"Valentin"}],"abstract":"Although changes in brain activity during learning have been extensively examined at the single neuron level, the coding strategies employed by cell populations remain mysterious. We examined cell populations in macaque area V4 during a rapid form of perceptual learning that emerges within tens of minutes. Multiple single units and LFP responses were recorded as monkeys improved their performance in an image discrimination task. We show that the increase in behavioral performance during learning is predicted by a tight coordination of spike timing with local population activity. More spike-LFP theta synchronization is correlated with higher learning performance, while high-frequency synchronization is unrelated with changes in performance, but these changes were absent once learning had stabilized and stimuli became familiar, or in the absence of learning. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of plasticity in visual cortex by which elevated low-frequency synchronization between individual neurons and local population activity accompanies the improvement in performance during learning.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08417"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08417"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"08417","entryfile":"elife-08417-v2.xml","files":["elife-08417-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-08417-v1.xml"]}
