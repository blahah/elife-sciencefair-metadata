Knowledge of the contemporary distribution of their shared vectors, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> remains incomplete and is complicated by an ongoing range expansion fuelled by increased global trade and travel. Mapping the global distribution of these vectors and the geographical determinants of their ranges is essential for public health planning. Here we compile the largest contemporary database for both species and pair it with relevant environmental variables predicting their global distribution. We show <italic>Aedes</italic> distributions to be the widest ever recorded; now extensive in all continents, including North America and Europe. These maps will help define the spatial limits of current autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses. It is only with this kind of rigorous entomological baseline that we can hope to project future health impacts of these viruses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"08347"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.08347"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"08347","entryfile":"elife-08347-v3.xml","files":["elife-08347-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08347-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08347-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08347-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08347-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08347-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08347-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-08347-v1.xml","elife-08347-v2.xml"]}
