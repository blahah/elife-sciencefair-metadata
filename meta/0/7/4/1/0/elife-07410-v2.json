In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the onset of centriole formation requires notably the proteins SAS-5 and SAS-6, which have functional equivalents across eukaryotic evolution. Whereas the molecular architecture of SAS-6 and its role in initiating centriole formation are well understood, the mechanisms by which SAS-5 and its relatives function is unclear. Here, we combine biophysical and structural analysis to uncover the architecture of SAS-5 and examine its functional implications in vivo. Our work reveals that two distinct self-associating domains are necessary to form higher-order oligomers of SAS-5: a trimeric coiled coil and a novel globular dimeric <italic>Implico</italic> domain. Disruption of either domain leads to centriole duplication failure in worm embryos, indicating that large SAS-5 assemblies are necessary for function in vivo.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07410"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07410"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07410","entryfile":"elife-07410-v2.xml","files":["elife-07410-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07410-v1.xml"]}
