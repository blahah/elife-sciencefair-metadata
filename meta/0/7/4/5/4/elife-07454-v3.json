{"title":"Contacts-based prediction of binding affinity in protein–protein complexes","author":[{"surname":"Vangone","given-names":"Anna"},{"surname":"Bonvin","given-names":"Alexandre MJJ"}],"abstract":"Almost all critical functions in cells rely on specific protein–protein interactions. Understanding these is therefore crucial in the investigation of biological systems. Despite all past efforts, we still lack a thorough understanding of the energetics of association of proteins. Here, we introduce a new and simple approach to predict binding affinity based on functional and structural features of the biological system, namely the network of interfacial contacts. We assess its performance against a protein–protein binding affinity benchmark and show that both experimental methods used for affinity measurements and conformational changes have a strong impact on prediction accuracy. Using a subset of complexes with reliable experimental binding affinities and combining our contacts and contact-types-based model with recent observations on the role of the non<bold>-</bold>interacting surface in protein–protein interactions, we reach a high prediction accuracy for such a diverse dataset outperforming all other tested methods.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07454"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07454"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07454","entryfile":"elife-07454-v3.xml","files":["elife-07454-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07454-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07454-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07454-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07454-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07454-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07454-v1.xml","elife-07454-v2.xml"]}
