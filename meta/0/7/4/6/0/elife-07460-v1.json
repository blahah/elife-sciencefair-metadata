Over a period of 51 weeks players were able to match computational alignments of genetic sequences in 78% of cases, and to improve them in 15% of cases. We also found that most players were only transiently interested in the game, and that the majority of the work done was performed by a small group of dedicated players. Based on our experiences we have built a linear model for the length of time that contributors are likely to donate to a crowd-sourced citizen science project. This model could serve a guide for the design and implementation of future crowd-sourced citizen science initiatives.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07460"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07460"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07460","entryfile":"elife-07460-v1.xml","files":["elife-07460-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07460-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
