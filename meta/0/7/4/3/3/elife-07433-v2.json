{"title":"The structure of plant photosystem I super-complex at 2.8 Å resolution","author":[{"surname":"Mazor","given-names":"Yuval"},{"surname":"Borovikova","given-names":"Anna"},{"surname":"Nelson","given-names":"Nathan"}],"abstract":"Most life forms on Earth are supported by solar energy harnessed by oxygenic photosynthesis. In eukaryotes, photosynthesis is achieved by large membrane-embedded super-complexes, containing reaction centers and connected antennae. Here, we report the structure of the higher plant PSI-LHCI super-complex determined at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure includes 16 subunits and more than 200 prosthetic groups, which are mostly light harvesting pigments. The complete structures of the four LhcA subunits of LHCI include 52 chlorophyll a and 9 chlorophyll b molecules, as well as 10 carotenoids and 4 lipids. The structure of PSI-LHCI includes detailed protein pigments and pigment–pigment interactions, essential for the mechanism of excitation energy transfer and its modulation in one of nature's most efficient photochemical machines.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07433"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07433"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07433","entryfile":"elife-07433-v2.xml","files":["elife-07433-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07433-v1.xml"]}
