However, recent studies in non-human primates have shown that neural activity does not simply represent muscle or movement parameters; instead, its temporal structure is well-described by a dynamical system where activity during movement evolves lawfully from an initial pre-movement state. In this study, we analyze neuronal ensemble activity in motor cortex in two clinical trial participants diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We find that activity in human motor cortex has similar dynamical structure to that of non-human primates, indicating that human motor cortex contains a similar underlying dynamical system for movement generation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07436"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07436"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"07436","entryfile":"elife-07436-v1.xml","files":["elife-07436-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07436-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07436-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07436-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07436-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
