The single subunit remodeler Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07432"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07432"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07432","entryfile":"elife-07432-v2.xml","files":["elife-07432-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07432-v1.xml"]}
