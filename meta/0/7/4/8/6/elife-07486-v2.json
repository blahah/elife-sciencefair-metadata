The requirements for these signals, however, vary from dispensable to essential in different infections. We examined the underlying mechanisms of this differential T cell costimulation dependence and found that the viral context determined the dependence on CD28/B7-mediated costimulation for expansion of naive and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that the requirement for costimulatory signals is not imprinted. Notably, related to the high-level costimulatory molecule expression induced by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), CD28/B7-mediated costimulation was dispensable for accumulation of LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells because of redundancy with the costimulatory pathways induced by TNF receptor family members (i.e., CD27, OX40, and 4-1BB). Type I IFN signaling in viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is slightly redundant with costimulatory signals. These results highlight that pathogen-specific conditions differentially and uniquely dictate the utilization of costimulatory pathways allowing shaping of effector and memory antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07486"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07486"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07486","entryfile":"elife-07486-v2.xml","files":["elife-07486-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07486-v1.xml"]}
