The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link>citations and Altmetric scores</ext-link> (<xref>Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate is a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases’ by Xu and colleagues, published in <italic>Cancer Cell</italic> in 2011 (<xref>Xu et al., 2011</xref>). The key experiments being replicated include Supplemental Figure 3I, which demonstrates that transfection with mutant forms of IDH1 increases levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), Figures 3A and 8A, which demonstrate changes in histone methylation after treatment with 2-HG, and Figures 3D and 7B, which show that mutant IDH1 can effect the same changes as treatment with excess 2-HG. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07420"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07420"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07420","entryfile":"elife-07420-v1.xml","files":[]}
