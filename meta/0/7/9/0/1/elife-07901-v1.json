{"title":"A putative ATPase mediates RNA transcription and capping in a dsRNA virus","author":[{"surname":"Yu","given-names":"Xuekui"},{"surname":"Jiang","given-names":"Jiansen"},{"surname":"Sun","given-names":"Jingchen"},{"surname":"Zhou","given-names":"Z Hong"}],"abstract":"mRNA transcription in dsRNA viruses is a highly regulated process but the mechanism of this regulation is not known. Here, by nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) assay and comparisons of six high-resolution (2.9–3.1 Å) cryo-electron microscopy structures of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus with bound ligands, we show that the large sub-domain of the guanylyltransferase (GTase) domain of the turret protein (TP) also has an ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) acts as a signal and binds the methylase-2 domain of TP to induce conformational change of the viral capsid, which in turn activates the putative ATPase. ATP binding/hydrolysis leads to an enlarged capsid for efficient mRNA synthesis, an open GTase domain for His217-mediated guanylyl transfer, and an open methylase-1 domain for SAM binding and methyl transfer. Taken together, our data support a role of the putative ATPase in mediating the activation of mRNA transcription and capping within the confines of the virus.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07901"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07901"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07901","entryfile":"elife-07901-v1.xml","files":["elife-07901-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07901-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
