In this study, we employ quantitative live imaging methods to assess the function of pairs of primary and shadow enhancers in the regulation of key patterning genes-<italic>knirps</italic>, <italic>hunchback</italic>, and <italic>snail</italic>-in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the <italic>hunchback</italic> enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly sub-additive behavior is also observed for <italic>snail</italic>, whereby removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. Quantitative modeling of enhancerâ€“promoter interactions suggests that weakly active enhancers function additively while strong enhancers behave sub-additively due to competition with the target promoter.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07956"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07956"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07956","entryfile":"elife-07956-v1.xml","files":["elife-07956-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07956-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07956-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07956-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07956-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07956-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
