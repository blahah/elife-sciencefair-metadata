While prior studies have reported dysregulation of effector and memory cells, little is known about the effects on naïve T cell populations. We performed a cross-sectional study of chronic hepatitis C (cHCV) patients using tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment to study antigen-specific inexperienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., tumor or unrelated virus-specific populations in tumor-free and sero-negative individuals). cHCV showed normal precursor frequencies, but increased proportions of memory-phenotype inexperienced cells, as compared to healthy donors or cured HCV patients. These observations could be explained by low surface expression of CD5, a negative regulator of TCR signaling. Accordingly, we demonstrated TCR hyperactivation and generation of potent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses from the altered T cell repertoire of cHCV patients. In sum, we provide the first evidence that naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are dysregulated during cHCV infection, and establish a new mechanism of immune perturbation secondary to chronic infection.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07916"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07916"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07916","entryfile":"elife-07916-v2.xml","files":["elife-07916-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig5-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-resp-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07916-v1.xml"]}
