Structural analyses revealed that the β-hairpin of 40S protein Rps5/uS7 protrudes into the 40S mRNA exit-channel, contacting the eIF2∙GTP∙Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> ternary complex (TC) and mRNA context nucleotides; but its importance in AUG selection was unknown. We identified substitutions in β-strand-1 and C-terminal residues of yeast Rps5 that reduced bulk initiation, conferred ‘leaky-scanning’ of AUGs; and lowered initiation fidelity by exacerbating the effect of poor context of the eIF1 AUG codon to reduce eIF1 abundance. Consistently, the β-strand-1 substitution greatly destabilized the ‘P<sub>IN</sub>’ conformation of TC binding to reconstituted 43S·mRNA complexes in vitro. Other substitutions in β-hairpin loop residues increased initiation fidelity and destabilized P<sub>IN</sub> at UUG, but not AUG start codons. We conclude that the Rps5 β-hairpin is as crucial as soluble initiation factors for efficient and accurate start codon recognition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07939"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07939"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"07939","entryfile":"elife-07939-v2.xml","files":["elife-07939-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07939-v1.xml"]}
