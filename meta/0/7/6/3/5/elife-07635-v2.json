K-fibers are composed of many microtubules that are held together throughout their length. Here, we show, using 3D electron microscopy, that K-fiber microtubules (MTs) are connected by a network of MT connectors. We term this network ‘the mesh’. The K-fiber mesh is made of linked multipolar connectors. Each connector has up to four struts, so that a single connector can link up to four MTs. Molecular manipulation of the mesh by overexpression of TACC3 causes disorganization of the K-fiber MTs. Optimal stabilization of K-fibers by the mesh is required for normal progression through mitosis. We propose that the mesh stabilizes K-fibers by pulling MTs together and thereby maintaining the integrity of the fiber. Our work thus identifies the K-fiber meshwork of linked multipolar connectors as a key integrator and determinant of K-fiber structure and function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07635"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07635"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07635","entryfile":"elife-07635-v2.xml","files":["elife-07635-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07635-v1.xml"]}
