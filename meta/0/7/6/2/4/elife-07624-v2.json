In sperm of marine invertebrates and mammals, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling has been intensely studied, whereas for fish little is known. In sea urchin sperm, a cyclic nucleotide-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel (CNGK) mediates a cGMP-induced hyperpolarization that evokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Here, we identify in sperm of the freshwater fish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> a novel CNGK family member featuring non-canonical properties. It is located in the sperm head rather than the flagellum and is controlled by intracellular pH, but not cyclic nucleotides. Alkalization hyperpolarizes sperm and produces Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces spinning-like swimming, different from swimming of sperm from other species. The “spinning” mode probably guides sperm into the micropyle, a narrow entrance on the surface of fish eggs. A picture is emerging of sperm channel orthologues that employ different activation mechanisms and serve different functions. The channel inventories probably reflect adaptations to species-specific challenges during fertilization.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07624"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07624"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07624","entryfile":"elife-07624-v2.xml","files":["elife-07624-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07624-v1.xml"]}
