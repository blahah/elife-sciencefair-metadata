Collectively, the resources support the generation of HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries consisting of consensus fragment ion spectra, and the analysis of quantitative digital maps of HLA peptidomes generated from a range of biological sources by SWATH mass spectrometry (MS). This study represents the first community-based effort to develop a robust platform for the reproducible and quantitative measurement of the entire repertoire of peptides presented by HLA molecules, an essential step towards the design of efficient immunotherapies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07661"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07661"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07661","entryfile":"elife-07661-v2.xml","files":["elife-07661-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07661-v1.xml"]}
