Despite progress in secondary structure modeling, high-throughput methods have generally failed to determine ncRNA tertiary structures, even at the 1-nm resolution that enables visualization of how helices and functional motifs are positioned in three dimensions. We report that integrating a new method called MOHCA-seq (<underline>M</underline>ultiplexed <underline>â€¢OH</underline><underline>C</underline>leavage <underline>A</underline>nalysis with paired-end <underline>seq</underline>uencing) with mutate-and-map secondary structure inference guides Rosetta 3D modeling to consistent 1-nm accuracy for intricately folded ncRNAs with lengths up to 188 nucleotides, including a blind RNA-puzzle challenge, the lariat-capping ribozyme. This multidimensional chemical mapping (MCM) pipeline resolves unexpected tertiary proximities for cyclic-di-GMP, glycine, and adenosylcobalamin riboswitch aptamers without their ligands and a loose structure for the recently discovered human HoxA9D internal ribosome entry site regulon. MCM offers a sequencing-based route to uncovering ncRNA 3D structure, applicable to functionally important but potentially heterogeneous states.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07600"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07600"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07600","entryfile":"elife-07600-v2.xml","files":["elife-07600-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07600-v1.xml"]}
