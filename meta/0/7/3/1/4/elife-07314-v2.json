Multiple signaling pathways in the integrated stress response phosphorylate eIF2 serine-51, inhibiting nucleotide exchange by eIF2B. ISRIB, a potent drug-like small molecule, renders cells insensitive to eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances cognitive function in rodents by blocking long-term depression. ISRIB was identified in a phenotypic cell-based screen, and its mechanism of action remained unknown. We now report that ISRIB is an activator of eIF2B. Our reporter-based shRNA screen revealed an eIF2B requirement for ISRIB activity. Our results define ISRIB as a symmetric molecule, show ISRIB-mediated stabilization of activated eIF2B dimers, and suggest that eIF2B4 (δ-subunit) contributes to the ISRIB binding site. We also developed new ISRIB analogs, improving its EC<sub>50</sub> to 600 pM in cell culture. By modulating eIF2B function, ISRIB promises to be an invaluable tool in proof-of-principle studies aiming to ameliorate cognitive defects resulting from neurodegenerative diseases.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07314"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07314"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07314","entryfile":"elife-07314-v2.xml","files":["elife-07314-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig15-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig16-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig17-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig18-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig19-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig20-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07314-v1.xml"]}
