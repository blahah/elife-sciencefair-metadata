We show by structural and biochemical analyses that Prp3 contains a bipartite U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding region comprising an expanded ferredoxin-like fold, which recognizes a 3′-overhang of U6 snRNA, and a preceding peptide, which binds U4/U6 stem II. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the single-stranded RNA-binding domain is exclusively found in Prp3 orthologs, thus qualifying as a spliceosome-specific RNA interaction module. The composite double-stranded/single-stranded RNA-binding region assembles cooperatively with Snu13 and Prp31 on U4/U6 di-snRNAs and inhibits Brr2-mediated U4/U6 di-snRNA unwinding in vitro. RNP-disrupting mutations in Prp3 lead to U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP assembly and splicing defects in vivo. Our results reveal how Prp3 acts as an important bridge between U4/U6 and U5 in the tri-snRNP and comparison with a Prp24-U6 snRNA recycling complex suggests how Prp3 may be involved in U4/U6 reassembly after splicing.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07320"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07320"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07320","entryfile":"elife-07320-v2.xml","files":["elife-07320-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07320-v1.xml"]}
