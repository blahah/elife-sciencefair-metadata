Despite this, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> remains largely unexplored from a genomic standpoint and is still described using a vocabulary based on serotyping reactions developed over half-a-century ago. Here we combine whole genome sequencing with geographical and temporal data to examine the natural history of the species. Our analysis subdivides <italic>S. flexneri</italic> into seven phylogenetic groups (PGs); each containing two-or-more serotypes and characterised by distinct virulence gene complement and geographic range. Within the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> PGs we identify geographically restricted sub-lineages that appear to have persistently colonised regions for many decades to over 100 years. Although we found abundant evidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinant acquisition, our dataset shows no evidence of subsequent intercontinental spread of antimicrobial resistant strains. The pattern of colonisation and AMR gene acquisition suggest that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> has a distinct life-cycle involving local persistence.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07335"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07335"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07335","entryfile":"elife-07335-v1.xml","files":["elife-07335-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07335-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
