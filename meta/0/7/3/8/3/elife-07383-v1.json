The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link>citations and Altmetric scores</ext-link> (<xref>Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from “Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET” by Peinado and colleagues, published in Nature Medicine in 2012 (<xref>Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). The key experiments being replicated are from Figures 4E, as well as Supplementary Figures 1C and 5A. In these experiments, Peinado and colleagues show tumor exosomes enhance metastasis to bones and lungs, which is diminished by reducing <italic>Met</italic> expression in exosomes (<xref>Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link> and the results of the replications will be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07383"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07383"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07383","entryfile":"elife-07383-v1.xml","files":[]}
