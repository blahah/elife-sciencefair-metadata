{"title":"miR-965 controls cell proliferation and migration during tissue morphogenesis in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdomen","author":[{"surname":"Verma","given-names":"Pushpa"},{"surname":"Cohen","given-names":"Stephen M"}],"abstract":"Formation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult abdomen involves a process of tissue replacement in which larval epidermal cells are replaced by adult cells. The progenitors of the adult epidermis are specified during embryogenesis and, unlike the imaginal discs that make up the thoracic and head segments, they remain quiescent during larval development. During pupal development, the abdominal histoblast cells proliferate and migrate to replace the larval epidermis. Here, we provide evidence that the microRNA, <italic>miR-965</italic>, acts via <italic>string</italic> and <italic>wingless</italic> to control histoblast proliferation and migration. Ecdysone signaling downregulates <italic>miR-965</italic> at the onset of pupariation, linking activation of the histoblast nests to the hormonal control of metamorphosis. Replacement of the larval epidermis by adult epidermal progenitors involves regulation of both cell-intrinsic events and cell communication. By regulating both cell proliferation and cell migration, <italic>miR-965</italic> contributes to the robustness of this morphogenetic system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07389"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07389"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07389","entryfile":"elife-07389-v2.xml","files":["elife-07389-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig5-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07389-v1.xml"]}
