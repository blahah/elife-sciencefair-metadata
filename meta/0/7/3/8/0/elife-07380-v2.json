{"title":"Structure of a type IV pilus machinery in the open and closed state","author":[{"surname":"Gold","given-names":"Vicki AM"},{"surname":"Salzer","given-names":"Ralf"},{"surname":"Averhoff","given-names":"Beate"},{"surname":"Kühlbrandt","given-names":"Werner"}],"abstract":"Proteins of the secretin family form large macromolecular complexes, which assemble in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Secretins are major components of type II and III secretion systems and are linked to extrusion of type IV pili (T4P) and to DNA uptake. By electron cryo-tomography of whole <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> cells, we determined the <italic>in situ</italic> structure of a T4P molecular machine in the open and the closed state. Comparison reveals a major conformational change whereby the N-terminal domains of the central secretin PilQ shift by ∼30 Å, and two periplasmic gates open to make way for pilus extrusion. Furthermore, we determine the structure of the assembled pilus.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07380"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07380"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07380","entryfile":"elife-07380-v2.xml","files":["elife-07380-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07380-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07380-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07380-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07380-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07380-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07380-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07380-v1.xml"]}
