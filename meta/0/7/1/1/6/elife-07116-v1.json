{"title":"Integrating between-host transmission and within-host immunity to analyze the impact of varicella vaccination on zoster","author":[{"surname":"Ogunjimi","given-names":"Benson"},{"surname":"Willem","given-names":"Lander"},{"surname":"Beutels","given-names":"Philippe"},{"surname":"Hens","given-names":"Niel"}],"abstract":"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and reactivation of latent VZV causes herpes zoster (HZ). VZV reactivation is subject to the opposing mechanisms of declining and boosted VZV-specific cellular mediated immunity (CMI). A reduction in exogenous re-exposure ‘opportunities’ through universal chickenpox vaccination could therefore lead to an increase in HZ incidence. We present the first individual-based model that integrates within-host data on VZV-CMI and between-host transmission data to simulate HZ incidence. This model allows estimating currently unknown pivotal biomedical parameters, including the duration of exogenous boosting at 2 years, with a peak threefold to fourfold increase of VZV-CMI; the VZV weekly reactivation probability at 5% and VZV subclinical reactivation having no effect on VZV-CMI. A 100% effective chickenpox vaccine given to 1 year olds would cause a 1.75 times peak increase in HZ 31 years after implementation. This increase is predicted to occur mainly in younger age groups than is currently assumed.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07116"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07116"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07116","entryfile":"elife-07116-v1.xml","files":["elife-07116-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07116-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
