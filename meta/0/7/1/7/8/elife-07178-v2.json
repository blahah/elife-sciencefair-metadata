In vitro, their counterparts are embryonic (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), respectively. Activation of the FGF signaling cascade results in mouse ESCs differentiating into mEpiSCs, indicative of its requirement in the shift between these states. However, only mouse ESCs correspond to the naive state; ESCs from other mammals and from chick show primed state characteristics. Thus, the significance of the naive state is unclear. In this study, we use zebra finch as a model for comparative ESC studies. The finch blastoderm has mESC-like properties, while chick blastoderm exhibits EpiSC features. In the absence of FGF signaling, finch cells retained expression of pluripotent markers, which were lost in cells from chick or aged finch epiblasts. Our data suggest that the naive state of pluripotency is evolutionarily conserved among amniotes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07178"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07178"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07178","entryfile":"elife-07178-v2.xml","files":["elife-07178-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07178-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07178-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07178-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07178-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07178-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07178-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07178-v1.xml"]}
