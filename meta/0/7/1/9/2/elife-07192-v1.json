Several studies have suggested that optical stimulation provides the precision and dynamic range requisite for closed-loop neuronal control, but no approach yet permits feedback control of neuronal firing. Here we present the ‘optoclamp’, a feedback control technology that provides continuous, real-time adjustments of bidirectional optical stimulation in order to lock spiking activity at specified targets over timescales ranging from seconds to days. We demonstrate how this system can be used to decouple neuronal firing levels from ongoing changes in network excitability due to multi-hour periods of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission blockade in vitro as well as impinging vibrissal sensory drive in vivo. This technology enables continuous, precise optical control of firing in neuronal populations in order to disentangle causally related variables of circuit activation in a physiologically and ethologically relevant manner.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07192"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07192"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07192","entryfile":"elife-07192-v1.xml","files":["elife-07192-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07192-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
