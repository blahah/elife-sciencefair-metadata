To test whether exosomal RNAs also contribute to changes in gene expression in recipient cells, and whether mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> might regulate the composition of secreted microRNAs (miRNAs), we compared small RNAs of cells and matched exosomes from isogenic CRC cell lines differing only in <italic>KRAS</italic> status. We show that exosomal profiles are distinct from cellular profiles, and mutant exosomes cluster separately from wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> exosomes. <italic>miR-10b</italic> was selectively increased in wild-type exosomes, while <italic>miR-100</italic> was increased in mutant exosomes. Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition caused accumulation of <italic>miR-100</italic> only in mutant cells, suggesting <italic>KRAS</italic>-dependent miRNA export. In Transwell co-culture experiments, mutant donor cells conferred <italic>miR-100</italic>-mediated target repression in wild-type-recipient cells. These findings suggest that extracellular miRNAs can function in target cells and uncover a potential new mode of action for mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> in CRC.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07197"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07197"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07197","entryfile":"elife-07197-v2.xml","files":["elife-07197-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07197-v1.xml"]}
