Recently, we and others made the surprising finding that PDAC and its preinvasive precursors, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), arise via reprogramming of mature acinar cells. We therefore hypothesized that the master regulator of acinar differentiation, PTF1A, could play a central role in suppressing PDAC initiation. In this study, we demonstrate that PTF1A expression is lost in both mouse and human PanINs, and that this downregulation is functionally imperative in mice for acinar reprogramming by oncogenic KRAS. Loss of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> alone is sufficient to induce acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, potentiate inflammation, and induce a KRAS-permissive, PDAC-like gene expression profile. As a result, <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-deficient acinar cells are dramatically sensitized to KRAS transformation, and reduced <italic>Ptf1a</italic> greatly accelerates development of invasive PDAC. Together, these data indicate that cell differentiation regulators constitute a new tumor suppressive mechanism in the pancreas.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07125"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07125"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07125","entryfile":"elife-07125-v2.xml","files":["elife-07125-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07125-v1.xml"]}
