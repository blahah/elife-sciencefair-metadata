In order to gain better insight into the genetic processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes in primates, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of cell types. To facilitate this, we generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from healthy donors. To demonstrate the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data from the chimpanzee iPSCs and the corresponding fibroblast lines, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their source lines, which encompass multiple populations and cell types. We observe much less within-species variation in iPSCs than in somatic cells, indicating the reprogramming process erases many inter-individual differences. The low within-species regulatory variation in iPSCs allowed us to identify many novel inter-species regulatory differences of small magnitude.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07103"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07103"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07103","entryfile":"elife-07103-v2.xml","files":["elife-07103-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07103-v1.xml"]}
