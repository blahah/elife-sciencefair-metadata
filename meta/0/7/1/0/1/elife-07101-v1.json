To identify new components of this pathway, we performed a screen for genes whose loss-of-function debilitated TP53 signaling and enabled oncogenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. We identified transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) as a putative tumor suppressor in the TP53 pathway. TGM2 suppressed colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. The depletion of growth supplements induced both <italic>TGM2</italic> expression and autophagy in a TP53-dependent manner, and TGM2 promoted autophagic flux by enhancing autophagic protein degradation and autolysosome clearance. Reduced expression of both <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, which regulates the cell cycle downstream of TP53, and <italic>TGM2</italic> synergized to promote oncogenic transformation. Our findings suggest that TGM2-mediated autophagy and CDKN1A-mediated cell cycle arrest are two important barriers in the TP53 pathway that prevent oncogenic transformation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07101"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07101"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07101","entryfile":"elife-07101-v1.xml","files":["elife-07101-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07101-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
