We identified a novel, evolutionarily diverse family of ER membrane proteins with StART-like lipid transfer domains and studied them in yeast. StART-like domains from Ysp2p and its paralog Lam4p specifically bind sterols, and Ysp2p, Lam4p and their homologs Ysp1p and Sip3p target punctate ER-PM contact sites distinct from those occupied by known ER-PM tethers. The activity of Ysp2p, reflected in amphotericin-sensitivity assays, requires its second StART-like domain to be positioned so that it can reach across ER-PM contacts. Absence of Ysp2p, Ysp1p or Sip3p reduces the rate at which exogenously supplied sterols traffic from the PM to the ER. Our data suggest that these StART-like proteins act <italic>in trans</italic> to mediate a step in sterol exchange between the PM and ER.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07253"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07253"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07253","entryfile":"elife-07253-v2.xml","files":["elife-07253-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07253-v1.xml"]}
