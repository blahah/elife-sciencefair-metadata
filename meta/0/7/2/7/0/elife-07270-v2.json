Here we report a cancer-promoting role for ATM. ATM depletion in metastatic cancer cells reduced cell migration and invasion. Transcription analyses identified a gene network, including the chemokine IL-8, regulated by ATM. <italic>IL-8</italic> expression required ATM and was regulated by oxidative stress. IL-8 was validated as an ATM target by its ability to rescue cell migration and invasion defects in ATM-depleted cells. Finally, ATM-depletion in human breast cancer cells reduced lung tumors in a mouse xenograft model and clinical data validated IL-8 in lung metastasis. These findings provide insights into how ATM activation by oxidative stress regulates <italic>IL-8</italic> to sustain cell migration and invasion in cancer cells to promote metastatic potential. Thus, in addition to well-established roles in tumor suppression, these findings identify a role for ATM in tumor progression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07270"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07270"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07270","entryfile":"elife-07270-v2.xml","files":["elife-07270-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07270-v1.xml"]}
