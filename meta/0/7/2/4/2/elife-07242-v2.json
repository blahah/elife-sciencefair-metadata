{"title":"Noise-induced plasticity of KCNQ2/3 and HCN channels underlies vulnerability and resilience to tinnitus","author":[{"surname":"Li","given-names":"Shuang"},{"surname":"Kalappa","given-names":"Bopanna I"},{"surname":"Tzounopoulos","given-names":"Thanos"}],"abstract":"Vulnerability to noise-induced tinnitus is associated with increased spontaneous firing rate in dorsal cochlear nucleus principal neurons, fusiform cells. This hyperactivity is caused, at least in part, by decreased Kv7.2/3 (KCNQ2/3) potassium currents. However, the biophysical mechanisms underlying resilience to tinnitus, which is observed in noise-exposed mice that do not develop tinnitus (non-tinnitus mice), remain unknown. Our results show that noise exposure induces, on average, a reduction in KCNQ2/3 channel activity in fusiform cells in noise-exposed mice by 4 days after exposure. Tinnitus is developed in mice that do not compensate for this reduction within the next 3 days. Resilience to tinnitus is developed in mice that show a re-emergence of KCNQ2/3 channel activity and a reduction in HCN channel activity. Our results highlight KCNQ2/3 and HCN channels as potential targets for designing novel therapeutics that may promote resilience to tinnitus.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07242"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07242"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07242","entryfile":"elife-07242-v2.xml","files":["elife-07242-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07242-v1.xml"]}
