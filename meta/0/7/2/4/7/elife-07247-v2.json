{"title":"Selections that isolate recombinant mitochondrial genomes in animals","author":[{"surname":"Ma","given-names":"Hansong"},{"surname":"O'Farrell","given-names":"Patrick H"}],"abstract":"Homologous recombination is widespread and catalyzes evolution. Nonetheless, its existence in animal mitochondrial DNA is questioned. We designed selections for recombination between co-resident mitochondrial genomes in various heteroplasmic <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines. In four experimental settings, recombinant genomes became the sole or dominant genome in the progeny. Thus, selection uncovers occurrence of homologous recombination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mtDNA and documents its functional benefit. Double-strand breaks enhanced recombination in the germline and revealed somatic recombination. When the recombination partner was a diverged <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome or a genome from a different species such as <italic>Drosophila yakuba</italic>, sequencing revealed long continuous stretches of exchange. In addition, the distribution of sequence polymorphisms in recombinants allowed us to map a selected trait to a particular region in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondrial genome. Thus, recombination can be harnessed to dissect function and evolution of mitochondrial genome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07247"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07247"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07247","entryfile":"elife-07247-v2.xml","files":["elife-07247-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07247-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07247-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07247-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07247-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07247-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07247-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07247-v1.xml"]}
