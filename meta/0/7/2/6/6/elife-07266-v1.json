In this paper, we dissected which functions of muscle Ctnnb1 are critical by an in vivo transgenic approach. We show that <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> mutant without the transactivation domain was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> mutation, indicating the involvement of transcription regulation. On the other hand, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable. We screened for proteins that may serve as a Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factor and identified Slit2. Transgenic expression of Slit2 specifically in the muscle was able to diminish presynaptic deficits by <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> mutation in mice. Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants. Together, these observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07266"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07266"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07266","entryfile":"elife-07266-v1.xml","files":["elife-07266-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07266-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
