{"title":"Negative regulation of ABA signaling by WRKY33 is critical for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> immunity towards <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> 2100","author":[{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Shouan"},{"surname":"Kracher","given-names":"Barbara"},{"surname":"Ziegler","given-names":"JÃ¶rg"},{"surname":"Birkenbihl","given-names":"Rainer P"},{"surname":"Somssich","given-names":"Imre E"}],"abstract":"The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant <italic>wrky33</italic> is highly susceptible to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>. We identified >1680 <italic>Botrytis</italic>-induced WRKY33 binding sites associated with 1576 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes. Transcriptional profiling defined 318 functional direct target genes at 14 hr post inoculation. Comparative analyses revealed that WRKY33 possesses dual functionality acting either as a repressor or as an activator in a promoter-context dependent manner. We confirmed known WRKY33 targets involved in hormone signaling and phytoalexin biosynthesis, but also uncovered a novel negative role of abscisic acid (ABA) in resistance towards <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100. The ABA biosynthesis genes <italic>NCED3</italic> and <italic>NCED5</italic> were identified as direct targets required for WRKY33-mediated resistance. Loss-of-WRKY33 function resulted in elevated ABA levels and genetic studies confirmed that WRKY33 acts upstream of <italic>NCED3/NCED5</italic> to negatively regulate ABA biosynthesis. This study provides the first detailed view of the genome-wide contribution of a specific plant transcription factor in modulating the transcriptional network associated with plant immunity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07295"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07295"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07295","entryfile":"elife-07295-v2.xml","files":["elife-07295-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07295-v1.xml"]}
