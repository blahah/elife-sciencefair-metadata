A major challenge in understanding ALS disease pathology has been the identification and atomic-level characterization of these conformers. Here, we use a combination of NMR methods to detect four distinct sparsely populated and transiently formed thermally accessible conformers in equilibrium with the native state of immature SOD1 (apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup>). Structural models of two of these establish that they possess features present in the mature dimeric protein. In contrast, the other two are non-native oligomers in which the native dimer interface and the electrostatic loop mediate the formation of aberrant intermolecular interactions. Our results show that apoSOD1<sup>2SH</sup> has a rugged free energy landscape that codes for distinct kinetic pathways leading to either maturation or non-native association and provide a starting point for a detailed atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms of SOD1 oligomerization.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07296"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07296"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07296","entryfile":"elife-07296-v1.xml","files":["elife-07296-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig9-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07296-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
