We used the zebrafish as a live model to identify and trail macrophage subtypes. We generated a transgenic line whose macrophages expressing <italic>tumour necrosis factor alpha</italic> (<italic>tnfa</italic>), a key feature of classically activated (M1) macrophages, express fluorescent proteins <italic>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF/tnfa:eGFP-F)</italic>. Using 4D-confocal microscopy, we showed that both aseptic wounding and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> inoculation triggered macrophage recruitment, some of which started to express <italic>tnfa</italic>. RT-qPCR on Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)-sorted tnfa<sup>+</sup> and tnfa<sup>−</sup> macrophages showed that they, respectively, expressed M1 and alternatively activated (M2) mammalian markers. Fate tracing of <italic>tnfa</italic><sup>undefined</sup> macrophages during the time-course of inflammation demonstrated that pro-inflammatory macrophages converted into M2-like phenotype during the resolution step. Our results reveal the diversity and plasticity of zebrafish macrophage subsets and underline the similarities with mammalian macrophages proposing a new system to study macrophage functional dynamic.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07288"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07288"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07288","entryfile":"elife-07288-v2.xml","files":["elife-07288-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07288-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07288-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07288-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07288-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07288-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07288-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07288-v1.xml"]}
