Wnt ligands trigger signaling by activating Frizzled receptors (FZDRs), which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. However, the mechanisms of G protein activation in Wnt signaling remain controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that FZDRs activate G proteins and trigger non-canonical Wnt signaling via the Dishevelled-binding protein, Daple. Daple contains a Gα-binding and activating (GBA) motif, which activates Gαi proteins and an adjacent domain that directly binds FZDRs, thereby linking Wnt stimulation to G protein activation. This triggers non-canonical Wnt responses, that is, suppresses the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway and tumorigenesis, but enhances PI3K-Akt and Rac1 signals and tumor cell invasiveness. In colorectal cancers, Daple is suppressed during adenoma-to-carcinoma transformation and expressed later in metastasized tumor cells. Thus, Daple activates Gαi and enhances non-canonical Wnt signaling by FZDRs, and its dysregulation can impact both tumor initiation and progression to metastasis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07091"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07091"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07091","entryfile":"elife-07091-v1.xml","files":["elife-07091-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07091-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
