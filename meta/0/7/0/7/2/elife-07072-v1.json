This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘BET bromodomain inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target c-Myc’ by Delmore and colleagues, published in <italic>Cell</italic> in 2011 (<xref>Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). The key experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3B and 7C-E. Delmore and colleagues demonstrated that treatment with JQ1, a small molecular inhibitor targeting BET bromodomains, resulted in the transcriptional down-regulation of the c-Myc oncogene in vitro (Figure 3B; <xref>Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). To assess the therapeutic efficacy of JQ1 in vivo, mice bearing multiple myeloma (MM) lesions were treated with JQ1 before evaluation for tumor burden and overall survival. JQ1 treatment significantly reduced disease burden and increased survival time (Figure 7C-E; <xref>Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link> and the results of the replications will be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07072"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07072"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07072","entryfile":"elife-07072-v1.xml","files":[]}
