These observations suggest an active selection process for tumor-initiating cells. Here, we use quantitative mRNA- and miR-Seq to determine the impact of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>undefined</sup> on the transcriptome of keratinocytes. We discover that <italic>microRNA-203</italic> is downregulated by <italic>Hras</italic><sup>undefined</sup>. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of <italic>microRNA-203</italic> promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells. Conversely, restoration of <italic>microRNA-203</italic> using an inducible model potently inhibits proliferation of these cells. We comprehensively identify <italic>microRNA-203</italic> targets required for <italic>Hras</italic>-initiated tumorigenesis. These targets include critical regulators of the <italic>Ras</italic> pathway and essential genes required for cell division. This study establishes a role for the loss of <italic>microRNA-203</italic> in promoting selection and expansion of <italic>Hras</italic> mutated cells and identifies a mechanism through which <italic>microRNA-203</italic> antagonizes <italic>Hras</italic>-mediated tumorigenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07004"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07004"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07004","entryfile":"elife-07004-v2.xml","files":["elife-07004-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig6-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07004-v1.xml"]}
