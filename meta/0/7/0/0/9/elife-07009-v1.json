Here we report on the factors that influenced the growth of the BioJS user and developer community, and outline our strategy for building on this growth. The lessons we have learned on BioJS may also be relevant to other open source software projects.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07009"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07009"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"07009","entryfile":"elife-07009-v1.xml","files":["elife-07009-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
