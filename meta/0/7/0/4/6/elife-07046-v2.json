{"title":"Maturation of a central brain flight circuit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling","author":[{"surname":"Agrawal","given-names":"Tarjani"},{"surname":"Hasan","given-names":"Gaiti"}],"abstract":"The final identity of a differentiated neuron is determined by multiple signaling events, including activity dependent calcium transients. Non-canonical Frizzled2 (Fz2) signaling generates calcium transients that determine neuronal polarity, neuronal migration, and synapse assembly in the developing vertebrate brain. Here, we demonstrate a requirement for Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in determining the final differentiated state of a set of central brain dopaminergic neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, referred to as the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster. Knockdown or inhibition of Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during maturation of the flight circuit in pupae reduces <italic>Tyrosine Hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>TH</italic>) expression in the PAM neurons and affects maintenance of flight. Thus, we demonstrate that Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during development serve as a pre-requisite for normal adult behavior. Our results support a neural mechanism where PAM neuron send projections to the α' and β' lobes of a higher brain centre, the mushroom body, and function in dopaminergic re-inforcement of flight.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07046"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07046"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07046","entryfile":"elife-07046-v2.xml","files":["elife-07046-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig7-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07046-v1.xml"]}
