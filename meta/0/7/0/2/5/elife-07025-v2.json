While numerous studies have examined genes underlying neoblast pluripotency, molecular pathways driving postmitotic fates remain poorly defined. In this study, we used transcriptional profiling of irradiation-sensitive and irradiation-insensitive cell populations and RNA interference (RNAi) functional screening to uncover markers and regulators of postmitotic progeny. We identified 32 new markers distinguishing two main epithelial progenitor populations and a planarian homolog to the MEX3 RNA-binding protein (<italic>Smed-mex3-1</italic>) as a key regulator of lineage progression. <italic>mex3-1</italic> was required for generating differentiated cells of multiple lineages, while restricting the size of the stem cell compartment. We also demonstrated the utility of using <italic>mex3-1(RNAi)</italic> animals to identify additional progenitor markers. These results identified <italic>mex3-1</italic> as a cell fate regulator, broadly required for differentiation, and suggest that <italic>mex3-1</italic> helps to mediate the balance between ASC self-renewal and commitment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07025"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07025"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07025","entryfile":"elife-07025-v2.xml","files":["elife-07025-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07025-v1.xml"]}
