Mechanisms whereby T-box3 regulates limb development are poorly understood. We discovered requirements for T-box at multiple stages of mouse limb development and distinct molecular functions in different tissue compartments. Early loss of T-box3 disrupts limb initiation, causing limb defects that phenocopy Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) mutants. Later ablation of T-box3 in posterior limb mesenchyme causes digit loss. In contrast, loss of anterior T-box3 results in preaxial polydactyly, as seen with dysfunction of primary cilia or Gli3-repressor. Remarkably, T-box3 is present in primary cilia where it colocalizes with Gli3. T-box3 interacts with Kif7 and is required for normal stoichiometry and function of a Kif7/Sufu complex that regulates Gli3 stability and processing. Thus, T-box3 controls digit number upstream of Shh-dependent (posterior mesenchyme) and Shh-independent, cilium-based (anterior mesenchyme) Hedgehog pathway function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07897"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07897"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07897","entryfile":"elife-07897-v1.xml","files":["elife-07897-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07897-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
