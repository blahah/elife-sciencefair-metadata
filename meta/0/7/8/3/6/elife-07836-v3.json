Here, we show that a lack of GSCs results in a broad transcriptional reprogramming in which the conserved detoxification regulator SKN-1/Nrf increases stress resistance, proteasome activity, and longevity. SKN-1 also activates diverse lipid metabolism genes and reduces fat storage, thereby alleviating the increased fat accumulation caused by GSC absence. Surprisingly, SKN-1 is activated by signals from this fat, which appears to derive from unconsumed yolk that was produced for reproduction. We conclude that SKN-1 plays a direct role in maintaining lipid homeostasis in which it is activated by lipids. This SKN-1 function may explain the importance of mammalian Nrf proteins in fatty liver disease and suggest that particular endogenous or dietary lipids might promote health through SKN-1/Nrf.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07836"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07836"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07836","entryfile":"elife-07836-v3.xml","files":["elife-07836-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07836-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07836-v1.xml","elife-07836-v2.xml"]}
