We generated mice with a heterozygous germ line deletion of a 2-Mb interval of chromosome band <italic>5A3</italic> syntenic to a commonly deleted segment of human <italic>7q22</italic> and show that mutant hematopoietic cells exhibit cardinal features of MDS. Specifically, the long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment is expanded in <italic>5A3</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mice, and the distribution of myeloid progenitors is altered. <italic>5A3</italic><sup>undefined</sup> HSCs are defective for lymphoid repopulating potential and show a myeloid lineage output bias. These cell autonomous abnormalities are exacerbated by physiologic aging and upon serial transplantation. The <italic>5A3</italic> deletion partially rescues defective repopulation in <italic>Gata2</italic> mutant mice. <italic>5A3</italic><sup>undefined</sup> hematopoietic cells exhibit decreased expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and perturbed oxygen consumption. These studies provide the first functional data linking 7q22 deletions to MDS pathogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07839"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07839"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07839","entryfile":"elife-07839-v2.xml","files":["elife-07839-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07839-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07839-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07839-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07839-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07839-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07839-v1.xml"]}
