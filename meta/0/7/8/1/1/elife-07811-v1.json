Furthermore, because mechanical stress is widespread, mechanical signals are difficult to uncouple from biochemical-based transduction pathways. Here we focus on the homeobox gene <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM</italic>), a master regulator and marker of meristematic identity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We found that <italic>STM</italic> expression is quantitatively correlated to curvature in the saddle-shaped boundary domain of the shoot apical meristem. As tissue folding reflects the presence of mechanical stress, we test and demonstrate that <italic>STM</italic> expression is induced after micromechanical perturbations. We also show that <italic>STM</italic> expression in the boundary domain is required for organ separation. While <italic>STM</italic> expression correlates with auxin depletion in this domain, auxin distribution and <italic>STM</italic> expression can also be uncoupled. <italic>STM</italic> expression and boundary identity are thus strengthened through a synergy between auxin depletion and an auxin-independent mechanotransduction pathway at the shoot apical meristem.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07811"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07811"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07811","entryfile":"elife-07811-v1.xml","files":["elife-07811-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07811-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
