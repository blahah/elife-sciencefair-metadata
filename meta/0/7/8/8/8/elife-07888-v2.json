Here, we demonstrate that the SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus (STIL) protein interacts via its coiled-coil region (STIL-CC) with PLK4 in vivo. STIL-CC is the first identified interaction partner of Polo-box 3 (PB3) of PLK4 and also uses a secondary interaction site in the PLK4 L1 region. Structure determination of free PLK4-PB3 and its STIL-CC complex via NMR and crystallography reveals a novel mode of Polo-box–peptide interaction mimicking coiled-coil formation. In vivo analysis of structure-guided STIL mutants reveals distinct binding modes to PLK4-PB3 and L1, as well as interplay of STIL oligomerization with PLK4 binding. We suggest that the STIL-CC/PLK4 interaction mediates PLK4 activation as well as stabilization of centriolar PLK4 and plays a key role in centriole duplication.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07888"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07888"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07888","entryfile":"elife-07888-v2.xml","files":["elife-07888-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07888-v1.xml"]}
