{"title":"On the dimensionality of odor space","author":[{"surname":"Meister","given-names":"Markus"}],"abstract":"There is great interest in understanding human olfactory experience from a principled and quantitative standpoint. The comparison is often made to color vision, where a solid framework with a three-dimensional perceptual space enabled a rigorous search for the underlying neural pathways, and the technological development of lifelike color display devices. A recent, highly publicized report claims that humans can discriminate at least 1 trillion odors, which exceeds by many orders of magnitude the known capabilities of color discrimination. This claim is wrong. I show that the failure lies in the mathematical method used to infer the size of odor space from a limited experimental sample. Further analysis focuses on establishing how many dimensions the perceptual odor space has. I explore the dimensionality of physical, neural, and perceptual spaces, drawing on results from bacteria to humans, and propose some experimental approaches to better estimate the number of discriminable odors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07865"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07865"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07865","entryfile":"elife-07865-v1.xml","files":["elife-07865-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07865-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07865-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-07865-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
