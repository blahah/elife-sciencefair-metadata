{"title":"A molecular mechanism underlying gustatory memory trace for an association in the insular cortex","author":[{"surname":"Adaikkan","given-names":"Chinnakkaruppan"},{"surname":"Rosenblum","given-names":"Kobi"}],"abstract":"Events separated in time are associatively learned in trace conditioning, recruiting more neuronal circuits and molecular mechanisms than in delay conditioning. However, it remains unknown whether a given sensory memory trace is being maintained as a unitary item to associate. Here, we used conditioned taste aversion learning in the rat model, wherein animals associate a novel taste with visceral nausea, and demonstrate that there are two parallel memory traces of a novel taste: a short-duration robust trace, lasting approximately 3 hr, and a parallel long-duration weak one, lasting up to 8 hr, and dependent on the strong trace for its formation. Moreover, only the early robust trace is maintained by a NMDAR-dependent CaMKII- AMPAR pathway in the insular cortex. These findings suggest that a memory trace undergoes rapid modifications, and that the mechanisms underlying trace associative learning differ when items in the memory are experienced at different time points.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07582"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07582"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07582","entryfile":"elife-07582-v2.xml","files":["elife-07582-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07582-v1.xml"]}
