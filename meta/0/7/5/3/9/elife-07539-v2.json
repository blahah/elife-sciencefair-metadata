Here we characterize the role of <italic>Ddb1</italic>, a component of the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex. <italic>Ddb1</italic> is highly expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and its deletion leads to abrogation of both adult and fetal hematopoiesis, targeting specifically transiently amplifying progenitor subsets. However, <italic>Ddb1</italic> deletion in non-dividing lymphocytes has no discernible phenotypes. <italic>Ddb1</italic> silencing activates Trp53 pathway and leads to significant effects on cell cycle progression and rapid apoptosis. The abrogation of hematopoietic progenitor cells can be partially rescued by simultaneous deletion of Trp53. Conversely, depletion of DDB1 in embryonic stem cell (ESC) leads to differentiation albeit negative effects on cell cycle and apoptosis. Mass spectrometry reveals differing protein interactions between DDB1 and distinct DCAFs, the substrate recognizing components of the E3 complex, between cell types. Our studies identify CUL4-DDB1 complex as a novel post-translational regulator of stem and progenitor maintenance and differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07539"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07539"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07539","entryfile":"elife-07539-v2.xml","files":["elife-07539-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07539-v1.xml"]}
