This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates, direction, and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network. Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability. To bridge this divide, we developed an integrated-imaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown, light-shielded roots. We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties, gene expression, and root system architecture traits. We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07597"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07597"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07597","entryfile":"elife-07597-v2.xml","files":["elife-07597-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig6-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07597-v1.xml"]}
