The cerebellum expresses several autism-linked genes, including <italic>GABRB3</italic>, which encodes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor Î²3 subunits and is among the maternal alleles deleted in Angelman syndrome. We tested how this <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mutation affects CbN physiology in mice, separating responses of males and females. Wild-type mice showed sex differences in synaptic excitation, inhibition, and intrinsic properties. Relative to females, CbN cells of males had smaller synaptically evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents, slower Purkinje-mediated IPSCs, and lower spontaneous firing rates, but rotarod performances were indistinguishable. In mutant CbN cells, IPSC kinetics were unchanged, but mutant males, unlike females, showed enlarged mGluR1/5 responses and accelerated spontaneous firing. These changes appear compensatory, since mutant males but not females performed indistinguishably from wild-type siblings on the rotarod task. Thus, sex differences in cerebellar physiology produce similar behavioral output, but provide distinct baselines for responses to mutations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"07596"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.07596"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"07596","entryfile":"elife-07596-v3.xml","files":["elife-07596-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-07596-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-07596-v1.xml","elife-07596-v2.xml"]}
