{"title":"TAF7L modulates brown adipose tissue formation","author":[{"surname":"Zhou","given-names":"Haiying"},{"surname":"Wan","given-names":"Bo"},{"surname":"Grubisic","given-names":"Ivan"},{"surname":"Kaplan","given-names":"Tommy"},{"surname":"Tjian","given-names":"Robert"}],"abstract":"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an essential role in metabolic homeostasis by dissipating energy via thermogenesis through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Previously, we reported that the TATA-binding protein associated factor 7L (TAF7L) is an important regulator of white adipose tissue (WAT) differentiation. In this study, we show that TAF7L also serves as a molecular switch between brown fat and muscle lineages in vivo and in vitro. In adipose tissue, TAF7L-containing TFIID complexes associate with PPARÎ³ to mediate DNA looping between distal enhancers and core promoter elements. Our findings suggest that the presence of the tissue-specific TAF7L subunit in TFIID functions to promote long-range chromatin interactions during BAT lineage specification.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02811"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02811"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02811","entryfile":"elife-02811-v2.xml","files":["elife-02811-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02811-v1.xml"]}
