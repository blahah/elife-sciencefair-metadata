{"title":"Inferring eye position from populations of lateral intraparietal neurons","author":[{"surname":"Graf","given-names":"Arnulf BA"},{"surname":"Andersen","given-names":"Richard A"}],"abstract":"Understanding how the brain computes eye position is essential to unraveling high-level visual functions such as eye movement planning, coordinate transformations and stability of spatial awareness. The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) is essential for this process. However, despite decades of research, its contribution to the eye position signal remains controversial. LIP neurons have recently been reported to inaccurately represent eye position during a saccadic eye movement, and to be too slow to support a role in high-level visual functions. We addressed this issue by predicting eye position and saccade direction from the responses of populations of LIP neurons. We found that both signals were accurately predicted before, during and after a saccade. Also, the dynamics of these signals support their contribution to visual functions. These findings provide a principled understanding of the coding of information in populations of neurons within an important node of the cortical network for visual-motor behaviors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02813"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02813"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02813","entryfile":"elife-02813-v1.xml","files":["elife-02813-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02813-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02813-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02813-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
