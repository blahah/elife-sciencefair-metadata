Two molecular modules composed of Fat(Ft)/Dachsous(Ds)/Four-jointed(Fj) and a ‘PCP-core’ including Frizzled(Fz) and Dishevelled(Dsh) contribute to polarization of individual cells. How polarity is globally coordinated with tissue axes is unresolved. Consistent with previous results, we find that the Ft/Ds/Fj-module has an effect on a MT-cytoskeleton. Here, we provide evidence for the model that the Ft/Ds/Fj-module provides directional information to the core-module through this MT organizing function. We show Ft/Ds/Fj-dependent initial polarization of the apical MT-cytoskeleton prior to global alignment of the core-module, reveal that the anchoring of apical non-centrosomal MTs at apical junctions is polarized, observe that directional trafficking of vesicles containing Dsh depends on Ft, and demonstrate the feasibility of this model by mathematical simulation. Together, these results support the hypothesis that Ft/Ds/Fj provides a signal to orient core PCP function via MT polarization.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02893"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02893"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02893","entryfile":"elife-02893-v2.xml","files":["elife-02893-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02893-v1.xml"]}
