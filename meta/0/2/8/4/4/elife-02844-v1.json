Here we describe a bizarre fly larva (Diptera), <italic>Qiyia jurassica</italic> gen. et sp. nov., from the Jurassic of China, that represents a stem group of the tabanomorph family Athericidae. <italic>Q. jurassica</italic> exhibits adaptations to an aquatic habitat. More importantly, it preserves an unusual combination of features including a thoracic sucker with six radial ridges, unique in insects, piercing-sucking mouthparts for fluid feeding, and crocheted ventral prolegs with upward directed bristles for anchoring and movement while submerged. We demonstrate that <italic>Q. jurassica</italic> was an aquatic ectoparasitic insect, probably feeding on the blood of salamanders. The finding reveals an extreme morphological specialization of fly larvae, and broadens our understanding of the diversity of ectoparasitism in Mesozoic insects.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02844"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02844"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02844","entryfile":"elife-02844-v1.xml","files":["elife-02844-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02844-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02844-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02844-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
