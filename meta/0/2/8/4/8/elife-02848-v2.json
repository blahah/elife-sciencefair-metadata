Cells must sense and respond to nutrients in their environment, and specialized cells must synthesize metabolic products required for their function. Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of specialized cells. How metabolic state contributes to stem cell differentiation is not understood. In this study, we show that RNA-binding by the stem cell translation regulator Musashi-1 (MSI1) is allosterically inhibited by 18–22 carbon ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acid binds to the N-terminal RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) and induces a conformational change that prevents RNA association. Musashi proteins are critical for development of the brain, blood, and epithelium. We identify stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 as a MSI1 target, revealing a feedback loop between ω-9 fatty acid biosynthesis and MSI1 activity. We propose that other RRM proteins could act as metabolite sensors to couple gene expression changes to physiological state.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02848"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02848"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02848","entryfile":"elife-02848-v2.xml","files":["elife-02848-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02848-v1.xml"]}
