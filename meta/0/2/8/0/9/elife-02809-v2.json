This functional decline begins with β cell stress and de-differentiation. Current drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) lower blood glucose levels but they do not directly alleviate β cell stress nor prevent, let alone reverse, β cell de-differentiation. We show here that Urocortin 3 (Ucn3), a marker for mature β cells, is down-regulated in the early stages of T2D in mice and when β cells are stressed in vitro. Using an insulin expression-coupled lineage tracer, with Ucn3 as a reporter for the mature β cell state, we screen for factors that reverse β cell de-differentiation. We find that a small molecule inhibitor of TGFβ receptor I (Alk5) protects cells from the loss of key β cell transcription factors and restores a mature β cell identity even after exposure to prolonged and severe diabetes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02809"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02809"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02809","entryfile":"elife-02809-v2.xml","files":["elife-02809-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02809-v1.xml"]}
