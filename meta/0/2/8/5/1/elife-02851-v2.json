Despite representing a significant public health burden, our understanding of the global distribution of the leishmaniases remains vague, reliant upon expert opinion and limited to poor spatial resolution. A global assessment of the consensus of evidence for leishmaniasis was performed at a sub-national level by aggregating information from a variety of sources. A database of records of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis occurrence was compiled from published literature, online reports, strain archives, and GenBank accessions. These, with a suite of biologically relevant environmental covariates, were used in a boosted regression tree modelling framework to generate global environmental risk maps for the leishmaniases. These high-resolution evidence-based maps can help direct future surveillance activities, identify areas to target for disease control and inform future burden estimation efforts.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02851"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02851"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"02851","entryfile":"elife-02851-v2.xml","files":["elife-02851-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02851-v1.xml"]}
