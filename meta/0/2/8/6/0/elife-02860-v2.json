The directed cell-to-cell distribution of auxin is achieved through a system of auxin influx and efflux transporters. PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are proposed auxin efflux transporters, and auxin fluxes can seemingly be predicted based on the—in many cells—asymmetric plasma membrane distribution of PINs. Here, we show in a heterologous <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system as well as in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> inflorescence stems that PIN-mediated auxin transport is directly activated by D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK) and PINOID (PID)/WAG kinases of the Arabidopsis AGCVIII kinase family. At the same time, we reveal that D6PKs and PID have differential phosphosite preferences. Our study suggests that PIN activation by protein kinases is a crucial component of auxin transport control that must be taken into account to understand auxin distribution within the plant.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02860"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02860"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02860","entryfile":"elife-02860-v2.xml","files":["elife-02860-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig10-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig10-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig10-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig11-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig8-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig8-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02860-v1.xml"]}
