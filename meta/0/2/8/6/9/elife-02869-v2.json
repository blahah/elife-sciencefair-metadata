To unravel these milestones we propose a framework, tumor evolutionary directed graphs (TEDG), which is able to characterize the history of genetic alterations by integrating longitudinal and cross-sectional genomic data. We applied TEDG to a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cohort of 70 patients spanning 12 years and show that: (a) the evolution of CLL follows a time-ordered process represented as a global flow in TEDG that proceeds from initiating events to late events; (b) there are two distinct and mutually exclusive evolutionary paths of CLL evolution; (c) higher fitness clones are present in later stages of the disease, indicating a progressive clonal replacement with more aggressive clones. Our results suggest that TEDG may constitute an effective framework to recapitulate the evolutionary history of tumors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02869"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02869"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02869","entryfile":"elife-02869-v2.xml","files":["elife-02869-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-resp-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02869-v1.xml"]}
