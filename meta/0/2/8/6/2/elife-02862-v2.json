{"title":"Delivery of circulating lipoproteins to specific neurons in the Drosophila brain regulates systemic insulin signaling","author":[{"surname":"Brankatschk","given-names":"Marko"},{"surname":"Dunst","given-names":"Sebastian"},{"surname":"Nemetschke","given-names":"Linda"},{"surname":"Eaton","given-names":"Suzanne"}],"abstract":"The Insulin signaling pathway couples growth, development and lifespan to nutritional conditions. Here, we demonstrate a function for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lipoprotein LTP in conveying information about dietary lipid composition to the brain to regulate Insulin signaling. When yeast lipids are present in the diet, free calcium levels rise in Blood Brain Barrier glial cells. This induces transport of LTP across the Blood Brain Barrier by two LDL receptor-related proteins: LRP1 and Megalin. LTP accumulates on specific neurons that connect to cells that produce Insulin-like peptides, and induces their release into the circulation. This increases systemic Insulin signaling and the rate of larval development on yeast-containing food compared with a plant-based food of similar nutritional content.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02862"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02862"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02862","entryfile":"elife-02862-v2.xml","files":["elife-02862-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02862-v1.xml"]}
