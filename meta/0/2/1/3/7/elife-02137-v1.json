The amount of centromeric CENP-A has direct implications for both the architecture and epigenetic inheritance of centromeres. Using complementary strategies, we determined that typical human centromeres contain ∼400 molecules of CENP-A, which is controlled by a mass-action mechanism. This number, despite representing only ∼4% of all centromeric nucleosomes, forms a ∼50-fold enrichment to the overall genome. In addition, although pre-assembled CENP-A is randomly segregated during cell division, this amount of CENP-A is sufficient to prevent stochastic loss of centromere function and identity. Finally, we produced a statistical map of CENP-A occupancy at a human neocentromere and identified nucleosome positions that feature CENP-A in a majority of cells. In summary, we present a quantitative view of the centromere that provides a mechanistic framework for both robust epigenetic inheritance of centromeres and the paucity of neocentromere formation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02137"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02137"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"07","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02137","entryfile":"elife-02137-v1.xml","files":["elife-02137-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02137-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
