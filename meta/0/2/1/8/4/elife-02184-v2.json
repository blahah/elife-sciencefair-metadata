Using deep-etch electron microscopy, we find that endogenous ESCRT-III filaments stabilized by depleting cells of Vps4 create uniform membrane-deforming conical spirals which are assemblies of specific ESCRT-III heteropolymers. To explore functional roles for ESCRT-III filaments, we examine HIV-1 Gag-mediated budding of virus-like particles and find that depleting Vps4 traps ESCRT-III filaments around nascent Gag assemblies. Interpolating between the observed structures suggests a new role for Vps4 in separating ESCRT-III from Gag or other cargo to allow centripetal growth of a neck constricting ESCRT-III spiral.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02184"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02184"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02184","entryfile":"elife-02184-v2.xml","files":["elife-02184-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02184-v1.xml"]}
