This role is specific to SerRS among all tRNA synthetases and is independent of its well-known aminoacylation function in protein synthesis. A unique nucleus-directing domain, added at the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition, confers this novel non-translational activity of SerRS. Previous studies showed that SerRS, in some unknown way, controls VEGFA expression to prevent vascular over-expansion. Using in vitro, cell and animal experiments, we show here that SerRS intervenes by antagonizing c-Myc, the major transcription factor promoting VEGFA expression, through a tandem mechanism. First, by direct head-to-head competition, nuclear-localized SerRS blocks c-Myc from binding to the <italic>VEGFA</italic> promoter. Second, DNA-bound SerRS recruits the SIRT2 histone deacetylase to erase prior c-Myc-promoted histone acetylation. Thus, vertebrate SerRS and c-Myc is a pair of ‘Yin-Yang’ transcriptional regulator for proper development of a functional vasculature. Our results also discover an anti-angiogenic activity for SIRT2.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02349"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02349"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02349","entryfile":"elife-02349-v1.xml","files":["elife-02349-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02349-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
