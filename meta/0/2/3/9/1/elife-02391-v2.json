The complexin accessory helix inhibits release and was proposed to insert into SNARE complexes to prevent their full assembly. This model was supported by ‘superclamp’ and ‘poor-clamp’ mutations that enhanced or decreased the complexin-I inhibitory activity in cell–cell fusion assays, and by the crystal structure of a superclamp mutant bound to a synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complex. NMR studies now show that the complexin-I accessory helix does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution, and electrophysiological data reveal that superclamp mutants have slightly stimulatory or no effects on neurotransmitter release, whereas a poor-clamp mutant inhibits release. Importantly, increasing or decreasing the negative charge of the complexin-I accessory helix inhibits or stimulates release, respectively. These results suggest a new model whereby the complexin accessory helix inhibits release through electrostatic (and perhaps steric) repulsion enabled by its location between the vesicle and plasma membranes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02391"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02391"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02391","entryfile":"elife-02391-v2.xml","files":["elife-02391-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02391-v1.xml"]}
