ATP and RecA play essential roles in the activation of pol V for DNA synthesis including translesion synthesis (TLS). We have established three features of the roles of ATP and RecA. (1) RecA-activated DNA polymerase V (pol V Mut), is a DNA-dependent ATPase; (2) bound ATP is required for DNA synthesis; (3) pol V Mut function is regulated by ATP, with ATP required to bind primer/template (p/t) DNA and ATP hydrolysis triggering dissociation from the DNA. Pol V Mut formed with an ATPase-deficient RecA E38K/K72R mutant hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, establishing the DNA-dependent ATPase as an intrinsic property of pol V Mut distinct from the ATP hydrolytic activity of RecA when bound to single-stranded (ss)DNA as a nucleoprotein filament (RecA*). No similar ATPase activity or autoregulatory mechanism has previously been found for a DNA polymerase.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02384"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02384"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"02384","entryfile":"elife-02384-v2.xml","files":["elife-02384-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02384-v1.xml"]}
