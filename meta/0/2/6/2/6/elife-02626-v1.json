To test whether evolutionary conservation of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) gives insight into human gene regulation, we determined transcription factor (TF) binding locations of four liver-essential TFs in liver tissue from human, macaque, mouse, rat, and dog. Approximately, two thirds of the TF-bound regions fell into CRMs. Less than half of the human CRMs were found as a CRM in the orthologous region of a second species. Shared CRMs were associated with liver pathways and disease loci identified by genome-wide association studies. Recurrent rare human disease causing mutations at the promoters of several blood coagulation and lipid metabolism genes were also identified within CRMs shared in multiple species. This suggests that multi-species analyses of experimentally determined combinatorial TF binding will help identify genomic regions critical for tissue-specific gene control.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02626"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02626"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"10","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02626","entryfile":"elife-02626-v1.xml","files":["elife-02626-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02626-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
