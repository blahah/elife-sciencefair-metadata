{"title":"Reconstitution of dynein transport to the microtubule plus end by kinesin","author":[{"surname":"Roberts","given-names":"Anthony J"},{"surname":"Goodman","given-names":"Brian S"},{"surname":"Reck-Peterson","given-names":"Samara L"}],"abstract":"Cytoplasmic dynein powers intracellular movement of cargo toward the microtubule minus end. The first step in a variety of dynein transport events is the targeting of dynein to the dynamic microtubule plus end, but the molecular mechanism underlying this spatial regulation is not understood. Here, we reconstitute dynein plus-end transport using purified proteins from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and dissect the mechanism using single-molecule microscopy. We find that two proteins–homologs of Lis1 and Clip170–are sufficient to couple dynein to Kip2, a plus-end-directed kinesin. Dynein is transported to the plus end by Kip2, but is not a passive passenger, resisting its own plus-end-directed motion. Two microtubule-associated proteins, homologs of Clip170 and EB1, act as processivity factors for Kip2, helping it overcome dynein's intrinsic minus-end-directed motility. This reveals how a minimal system of proteins transports a molecular motor to the start of its track.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02641"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02641"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02641","entryfile":"elife-02641-v1.xml","files":["elife-02641-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02641-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
