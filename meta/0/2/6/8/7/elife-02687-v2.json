The Rabex-5 GEF activity is autoinhibited by the Rabex-5 CC domain (Rabex-5CC) and activated by the Rabaptin-5 C2-1 domain (Rabaptin-5C21) with yet unknown mechanism. We report here the crystal structures of Rabex-5 in complex with the dimeric Rabaptin-5C21 (Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub>) and in complex with Rabaptin-5C21<sub>2</sub> and Rab5, along with biophysical and biochemical analyses. We show that Rabex-5CC assumes an amphipathic Î±-helix which binds weakly to the substrate-binding site of the GEF domain, leading to weak autoinhibition of the GEF activity. Binding of Rabaptin-5C21 to Rabex-5 displaces Rabex-5CC to yield a largely exposed substrate-binding site, leading to release of the GEF activity. In the ternary complex the substrate-binding site of Rabex-5 is completely exposed to bind and activate Rab5. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism for the regulation of the Rabex-5 GEF activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02687"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02687"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02687","entryfile":"elife-02687-v2.xml","files":["elife-02687-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02687-v1.xml"]}
