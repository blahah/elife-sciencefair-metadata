We prospectively identified, and isolated by flow cytometry, adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) NICs as Glast<sup>mid</sup>EGFR<sup>high</sup>PlexinB2<sup>high</sup>CD24<sup>−/low</sup>O4/PSA-NCAM<sup>−/low</sup>Ter119/CD45<sup>−</sup> (GEPCOT) cells. They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with <italic>Ascl1</italic><sup>undefined</sup> and <italic>Dlx1</italic><sup>undefined</sup>. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers <italic>Slc1a3-CreER</italic><sup>undefined</sup>, <italic>GFAP-CreER</italic><sup>undefined</sup>, <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>undefined</sup>, and <italic>Gli1</italic><sup>undefined</sup> and were long-lived in vivo. While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide, pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the <italic>Bmi-1</italic> polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> (<italic>p16</italic><sup>undefined</sup>) repression. Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02669"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02669"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02669","entryfile":"elife-02669-v2.xml","files":["elife-02669-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02669-v1.xml"]}
