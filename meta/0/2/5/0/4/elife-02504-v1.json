{"title":"Genome-wide mapping in a house mouse hybrid zone reveals hybrid sterility loci and Dobzhansky-Muller interactions","author":[{"surname":"Turner","given-names":"Leslie M"},{"surname":"Harr","given-names":"Bettina"}],"abstract":"Mapping hybrid defects in contact zones between incipient species can identify genomic regions contributing to reproductive isolation and reveal genetic mechanisms of speciation. The house mouse features a rare combination of sophisticated genetic tools and natural hybrid zones between subspecies. Male hybrids often show reduced fertility, a common reproductive barrier between incipient species. Laboratory crosses have identified sterility loci, but each encompasses hundreds of genes. We map genetic determinants of testis weight and testis gene expression using offspring of mice captured in a hybrid zone between <italic>M. musculus musculus</italic> and <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>. Many generations of admixture enables high-resolution mapping of loci contributing to these sterility-related phenotypes. We identify complex interactions among sterility loci, suggesting multiple, non-independent genetic incompatibilities contribute to barriers to gene flow in the hybrid zone.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02504"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02504"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02504","entryfile":"elife-02504-v1.xml","files":["elife-02504-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02504-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
