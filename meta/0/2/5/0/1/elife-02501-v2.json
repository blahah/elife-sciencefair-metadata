The physiological necessity of these quality control mechanisms in different environments remains unclear, as the cost vs benefit of accurate protein synthesis is difficult to predict. We show that in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a non-coded amino acid produced through oxidative damage is a significant threat to the accuracy of protein synthesis and must be cleared by phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase in order to prevent cellular toxicity caused by mis-synthesized proteins. These findings demonstrate how stress can lead to the accumulation of non-canonical amino acids that must be excluded from the proteome in order to maintain cellular viability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02501"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02501"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02501","entryfile":"elife-02501-v2.xml","files":["elife-02501-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02501-v1.xml"]}
