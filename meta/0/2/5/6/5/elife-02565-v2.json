{"title":"A user-friendly, open-source tool to project impact and cost of diagnostic tests for tuberculosis","author":[{"surname":"Dowdy","given-names":"David W"},{"surname":"Andrews","given-names":"Jason R"},{"surname":"Dodd","given-names":"Peter J"},{"surname":"Gilman","given-names":"Robert H"}],"abstract":"Most models of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), do not provide results customized to local conditions. We created a dynamic transmission model to project TB incidence, TB mortality, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB prevalence, and incremental costs over 5 years after scale-up of nine alternative diagnostic strategies. A corresponding web-based interface allows users to specify local costs and epidemiology. In settings with little capacity for up-front investment, same-day microscopy had the greatest impact on TB incidence and became cost-saving within 5 years if delivered at $10/test. With greater initial investment, population-level scale-up of Xpert MTB/RIF or microcolony-based culture often averted 10 times more TB cases than narrowly-targeted strategies, at minimal incremental long-term cost. Xpert for smear-positive TB had reasonable impact on MDR-TB incidence, but at substantial price and little impact on overall TB incidence and mortality. This user-friendly modeling framework improves decision-makers' ability to evaluate the local impact of TB diagnostic strategies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02565"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02565"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02565","entryfile":"elife-02565-v2.xml","files":["elife-02565-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02565-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02565-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02565-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02565-v1.xml"]}
