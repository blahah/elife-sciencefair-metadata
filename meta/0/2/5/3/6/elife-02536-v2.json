In this study, we show in awake mice at rest that spiking activity of Purkinje cells, the sole output cells of the cerebellar cortex, differs between cerebellar modules and correlates with their expression of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C or zebrin. Simple spike and complex spike frequencies were significantly higher in Purkinje cells located in zebrin-negative than zebrin-positive modules. The difference in simple spike frequency persisted when the synaptic input to, but not intrinsic activity of, Purkinje cells was manipulated. Blocking TRPC3, the effector channel of a cascade of proteins that have zebrin-like distribution patterns, attenuated the simple spike frequency difference. Our results indicate that zebrin-discriminated cerebellar modules operate at different frequencies, which depend on activation of TRPC3, and that this property is relevant for all cerebellar functions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02536"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02536"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02536","entryfile":"elife-02536-v2.xml","files":["elife-02536-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02536-v1.xml"]}
