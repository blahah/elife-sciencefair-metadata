Our knowledge of these components and pathways is far from exhaustive. In recent decades, the nuclear envelope has emerged as a global gene regulatory machine, although its role in circadian regulation has not been explored. We report that transcription of the core clock component <italic>BMAL1</italic> is positively modulated by the inner nuclear membrane protein MAN1, which directly binds the <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter and enhances its transcription. Our results establish a novel connection between the nuclear periphery and circadian rhythmicity, therefore bridging two global regulatory systems that modulate all aspects of bodily functions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02981"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02981"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"09","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02981","entryfile":"elife-02981-v1.xml","files":["elife-02981-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02981-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
