{"title":"Autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder among individuals with a family history of alcohol use disorders","author":[{"surname":"Sundquist","given-names":"Jan"},{"surname":"Sundquist","given-names":"Kristina"},{"surname":"Ji","given-names":"Jianguang"}],"abstract":"Recent studies suggest de novo mutations may involve the pathogenesis of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Based on the evidence that excessive alcohol consumption may be associated with an increased rate of de novo mutations in germ cells (sperms or eggs), we examine here whether the risks of autism and ADHD are increased among individuals with a family history of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of autism and ADHD among individuals with a biological parental history of AUDs were 1.39 (95% CI 1.34–1.44) and 2.19 (95% CI 2.15–2.23), respectively, compared to individuals without an affected parent. Among offspring whose parents were diagnosed with AUDs before their birth, the corresponding risks were 1.46 (95% CI 1.36–1.58) and 2.70 (95% CI 2.59–2.81), respectively. Our study calls for extra surveillance for children with a family history of AUDs, and further studies examining the underlying mechanisms are needed.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02917"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02917"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02917","entryfile":"elife-02917-v1.xml","files":[]}
