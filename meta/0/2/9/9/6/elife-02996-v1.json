Here, we gained novel functional insight about heterochromatic PTMs by analyzing histone H3 purified from the heterochromatic germline micronucleus of the model organism <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. Mass spectrometric sequencing of micronuclear H3 identified H3K23 trimethylation (H3K23me3), a previously uncharacterized PTM. H3K23me3 became particularly enriched during meiotic leptotene and zygotene in germline chromatin of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Loss of H3K23me3 in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> through deletion of the methyltransferase Ezl3p caused mislocalization of meiosis-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to heterochromatin, and a decrease in progeny viability. These results show that an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway regulates H3K23me3 during meiosis, and our studies in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> suggest this pathway may function to protect heterochromatin from DSBs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02996"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02996"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02996","entryfile":"elife-02996-v1.xml","files":["elife-02996-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02996-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
