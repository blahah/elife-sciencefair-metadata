The configuration and function of the kinetochoreâ€“centromere interface is poorly understood. We report that a protein at this interface, CENP-M, is structurally and evolutionarily related to small GTPases but is incapable of GTP-binding and conformational switching. We show that CENP-M is crucially required for the assembly and stability of a tetramer also comprising CENP-I, CENP-H, and CENP-K, the HIKM complex, which we extensively characterize through a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell biological approaches. A point mutant affecting the CENP-M/CENP-I interaction hampers kinetochore assembly and chromosome alignment and prevents kinetochore recruitment of the CENP-T/W complex, questioning a role of CENP-T/W as founder of an independent axis of kinetochore assembly. Our studies identify a single pathway having CENP-C as founder, and CENP-H/I/K/M and CENP-T/W as CENP-C-dependent followers.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02978"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02978"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"07","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02978","entryfile":"elife-02978-v1.xml","files":["elife-02978-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02978-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
