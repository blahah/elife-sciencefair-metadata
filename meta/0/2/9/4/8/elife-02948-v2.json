Most oncogenes, however, require a combination of at least two signals to promote proliferation. In this study, we present evidence that Yap activation is insufficient to promote growth in the otherwise normal tissue. Using a mosaic mouse model, we demonstrate that Yap overexpression in a fraction of hepatocytes does not lead to their clonal expansion, as proliferation is counterbalanced by increased apoptosis. To shift the activity of Yap towards growth, a second signal provided by tissue damage or inflammation is required. In response to liver injury, Yap drives clonal expansion, suppresses hepatocyte differentiation, and promotes a progenitor phenotype. These results suggest that Yap activation is insufficient to promote growth in the absence of a second signal thus coordinating tissue homeostasis and repair.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02948"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02948"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02948","entryfile":"elife-02948-v2.xml","files":["elife-02948-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02948-v1.xml"]}
