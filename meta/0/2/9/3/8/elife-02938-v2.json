{"title":"<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> male sensory-motor neurons and dopaminergic support cells couple ejaculation and post-ejaculatory behaviors","author":[{"surname":"LeBoeuf","given-names":"Brigitte"},{"surname":"Correa","given-names":"Paola"},{"surname":"Jee","given-names":"Changhoon"},{"surname":"García","given-names":"L René"}],"abstract":"The circuit structure and function underlying post-coital male behaviors remain poorly understood. Using mutant analysis, laser ablation, optogenetics, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we observed that following <italic>C. elegans</italic> male copulation, the duration of post-coital lethargy is coupled to cellular events involved in ejaculation. We show that the SPV and SPD spicule-associated sensory neurons and the spicule socket neuronal support cells function with intromission circuit components, including the cholinergic SPC and PCB and the glutamatergic PCA sensory-motor neurons, to coordinate sex muscle contractions with initiation and continuation of sperm movement. Our observations suggest that the SPV and SPD and their associated dopamine-containing socket cells sense the intrauterine environment through cellular endings exposed at the spicule tips and regulate both sperm release into the hermaphrodite and the recovery from post-coital lethargy.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02938"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02938"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02938","entryfile":"elife-02938-v2.xml","files":["elife-02938-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig8-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02938-v1.xml"]}
