The target-based resistance spectrum for GE is unusually small, reflecting the fact that the GE binding site on RNAP includes residues of the RNAP active center that cannot be substituted without loss of RNAP activity. The GE binding site on RNAP is different from the rifamycin binding site. Accordingly, GE and rifamycins do not exhibit cross-resistance, and GE and a rifamycin can bind simultaneously to RNAP. The GE binding site on RNAP is immediately adjacent to the rifamycin binding site. Accordingly, covalent linkage of GE to a rifamycin provides a bipartite inhibitor having very high potency and very low susceptibility to target-based resistance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02450"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02450"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02450","entryfile":"elife-02450-v1.xml","files":["elife-02450-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02450-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
