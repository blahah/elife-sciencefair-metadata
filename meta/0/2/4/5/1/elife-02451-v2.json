We show that Sal inhibits RNA synthesis in cells and that mutations that confer Sal-resistance map to RNAP genes. We show that Sal interacts with the RNAP active-center ‘bridge-helix cap’ comprising the ‘bridge-helix N-terminal hinge’, ‘F-loop’, and ‘link region’. We show that Sal inhibits nucleotide addition in transcription initiation and elongation. We present a crystal structure that defines interactions between Sal and RNAP and effects of Sal on RNAP conformation. We propose that Sal functions by binding to the RNAP bridge-helix cap and preventing conformational changes of the bridge-helix N-terminal hinge necessary for nucleotide addition. The results provide a target for antibacterial drug discovery and a reagent to probe conformation and function of the bridge-helix N-terminal hinge.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02451"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02451"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02451","entryfile":"elife-02451-v2.xml","files":["elife-02451-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02451-v1.xml"]}
