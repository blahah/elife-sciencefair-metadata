Initiation of HR in the G1 phase blocks non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) impairing DSB repair. Completion of HR in G1 cells can lead to the loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), which is potentially carcinogenic. We conducted a gain-of-function screen to identify miRNAs that regulate HR-mediated DSB repair, and of these miRNAs, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* specifically suppress the HR-pathway in the G1 phase. These miRNAs target the transcripts of HR factors, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, and inhibiting miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* increases expression of BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51 specifically in the G1-phase leading to impaired DSB repair. Depletion of CtIP, a BRCA1-associated DNA end resection protein, rescues this phenotype. Furthermore, deletion of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* in independent cohorts of ovarian tumors correlates with significant increase in LOH events/chromosomal aberrations and BRCA1 expression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02445"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02445"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02445","entryfile":"elife-02445-v2.xml","files":["elife-02445-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02445-v1.xml"]}
