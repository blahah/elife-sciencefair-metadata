Through integrative analysis of clinical breast cancer gene expression datasets, cell line models of breast cancer progression, and mutation data from cancer genome resequencing studies, we identified <italic>RNA binding motif protein 47 (RBM47)</italic> as a suppressor of breast cancer progression and metastasis. RBM47 inhibited breast cancer re-initiation and growth in experimental models. Transcriptome-wide HITS-CLIP analysis revealed widespread RBM47 binding to mRNAs, most prominently in introns and 3′UTRs. RBM47 altered splicing and abundance of a subset of its target mRNAs. Some of the mRNAs stabilized by RBM47, as exemplified by <italic>dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1</italic>, inhibit tumor progression downstream of RBM47. Our work identifies RBM47 as an RNA-binding protein that can suppress breast cancer progression and demonstrates how the inactivation of a broadly targeted RNA chaperone enables selection of a pro-metastatic state.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02734"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02734"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02734","entryfile":"elife-02734-v2.xml","files":["elife-02734-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02734-v1.xml"]}
