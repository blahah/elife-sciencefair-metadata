Here we reconstruct the neuronal connectome of a four-eye visual circuit in the larva of the annelid <italic>Platynereis</italic> using serial-section transmission electron microscopy. In this 71-neuron circuit, photoreceptors connect via three layers of interneurons to motorneurons, which innervate trunk muscles. By combining eye ablations with behavioral experiments, we show that the circuit compares light on either side of the body and stimulates body bending upon left-right light imbalance during visual phototaxis. We also identified an interneuron motif that enhances sensitivity to different light intensity contrasts. The <italic>Platynereis</italic> eye circuit has the hallmarks of a visual system, including spatial light detection and contrast modulation, illustrating how image-forming eyes may have evolved via intermediate stages contrasting only a light and a dark field during a simple visual task.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02730"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02730"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02730","entryfile":"elife-02730-v2.xml","files":["elife-02730-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig4-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02730-v1.xml"]}
