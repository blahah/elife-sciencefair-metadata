Although the function of miR-9 has been well characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. In order to target miR-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allowing conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, we found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02755"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02755"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02755","entryfile":"elife-02755-v1.xml","files":["elife-02755-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02755-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
