{"title":"Sensory experience during locomotion promotes recovery of function in adult visual cortex","author":[{"surname":"Kaneko","given-names":"Megumi"},{"surname":"Stryker","given-names":"Michael P"}],"abstract":"Recovery from sensory deprivation is slow and incomplete in adult visual cortex. In this study, we show that visual stimulation during locomotion, which increases the gain of visual responses in primary visual cortex, dramatically enhances recovery in the mouse. Excitatory neurons regained normal levels of response, while narrow-spiking (inhibitory) neurons remained less active. Visual stimulation or locomotion alone did not enhance recovery. Responses to the particular visual stimuli viewed by the animal during locomotion recovered, while those to another normally effective stimulus did not, suggesting that locomotion promotes the recovery only of the neural circuits that are activated concurrent with the locomotion. These findings may provide an avenue for improving recovery from amblyopia in humans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02798"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02798"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02798","entryfile":"elife-02798-v1.xml","files":["elife-02798-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02798-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
