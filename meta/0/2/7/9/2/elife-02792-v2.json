However, it is unknown whether histones themselves have evolved to regulate chromatin compaction. Analysis of histone sequences from 160 eukaryotes revealed that the H2A N-terminus has systematically acquired arginines as genomes expanded. Insertion of arginines into their evolutionarily conserved position in H2A of a small-genome organism increased linear compaction by as much as 40%, while their absence markedly diminished compaction in cells with large genomes. This effect was recapitulated in vitro with nucleosomal arrays using unmodified histones, indicating that the H2A N-terminus directly modulates the chromatin fiber likely through intra- and inter-nucleosomal arginineâ€“DNA contacts to enable tighter nucleosomal packing. Our findings reveal a novel evolutionary mechanism for regulation of chromatin compaction and may explain the frequent mutations of the H2A N-terminus in cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02792"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02792"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02792","entryfile":"elife-02792-v2.xml","files":["elife-02792-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02792-v1.xml"]}
