We identify five different circadian (E) neurons that are a major source of rhythmicity and locomotor activity. Brief firing of PDF cells at different times of day generates a phase response curve (PRC), which mimics a light-mediated PRC and requires PDF receptor expression in the five E neurons. Firing also resembles light by causing TIM degradation in downstream neurons. Unlike light however, firing-mediated phase-shifting is CRY-independent and exploits the E3 ligase component CUL-3 in the early night to degrade TIM. Our results suggest that PDF neurons integrate light information and then modulate the phase of E cell oscillations and behavioral rhythms. The results also explain how fly brain rhythms persist in constant darkness and without CRY.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02780"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02780"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02780","entryfile":"elife-02780-v2.xml","files":["elife-02780-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02780-v1.xml"]}
