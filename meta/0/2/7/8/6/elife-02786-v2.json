Although active cell-in-cell invasion depends on RhoA and actin, the precise mechanism as well as the underlying actin structures and assembly factors driving the process are unknown. Furthermore, whether specific cell surface receptors trigger entotic invasion in a signal-dependent fashion has not been investigated. In this study, we identify the G-protein-coupled LPA receptor 2 (LPAR2) as a signal transducer specifically required for the actively invading cell during entosis. We find that G<sub>12/13</sub> and PDZ-RhoGEF are required for entotic invasion, which is driven by blebbing and a uropod-like actin structure at the rear of the invading cell. Finally, we provide evidence for an involvement of the RhoA-regulated formin Dia1 for entosis downstream of LPAR2. Thus, we delineate a signaling process that regulates actin dynamics during cell-in-cell invasion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02786"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02786"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02786","entryfile":"elife-02786-v2.xml","files":["elife-02786-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02786-v1.xml"]}
