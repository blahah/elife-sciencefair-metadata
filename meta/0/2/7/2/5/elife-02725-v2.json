Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we here confirm an MMR-deficient mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations escaping MMR. Moreover, we identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect microsatellite instability (MSI). Indeed, using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Additionally, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the ‘DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination’ pathway. Consequently, DSB repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, triggering a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02725"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02725"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02725","entryfile":"elife-02725-v2.xml","files":["elife-02725-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02725-v1.xml"]}
