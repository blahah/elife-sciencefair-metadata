In this study, we report that resveratrol acts as a pathway-selective estrogen receptor-α (ERα) ligand to modulate the inflammatory response but not cell proliferation. A crystal structure of the ERα ligand-binding domain (LBD) as a complex with resveratrol revealed a unique perturbation of the coactivator-binding surface, consistent with an altered coregulator recruitment profile. Gene expression analyses revealed significant overlap of TNFα genes modulated by resveratrol and estradiol. Furthermore, the ability of resveratrol to suppress <italic>interleukin-6</italic> transcription was shown to require ERα and several ERα coregulators, suggesting that ERα functions as a primary conduit for resveratrol activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02057"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02057"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02057","entryfile":"elife-02057-v2.xml","files":["elife-02057-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig7-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02057-v1.xml"]}
