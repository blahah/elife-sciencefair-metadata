How the BCR becomes signaling-competent upon antigen binding is still a matter of controversy. Using a high-resolution proximity ligation assay (PLA) to monitor the conformation of the BCR and its interactions with co-receptors at a 10–20 nm resolution, we provide direct evidence for the opening of BCR dimers during B cell activation. We also show that upon binding Syk opens the receptor by an inside-out signaling mechanism that amplifies BCR signaling. Furthermore, we found that on resting B cells, the coreceptor CD19 is in close proximity with the IgD-BCR and on activated B cells with the IgM-BCR, indicating nanoscale reorganization of receptor clusters during B cell activation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02069"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02069"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02069","entryfile":"elife-02069-v1.xml","files":["elife-02069-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-02069-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
