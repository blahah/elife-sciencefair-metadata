{"title":"Systems analysis of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism in cyanobacteria","author":[{"surname":"Mangan","given-names":"Niall M"},{"surname":"Brenner","given-names":"Michael P"}],"abstract":"Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria with a unique CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism (CCM), enhancing carbon fixation. Understanding the CCM requires a systems level perspective of how molecular components work together to enhance CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. We present a mathematical model of the cyanobacterial CCM, giving the parameter regime (expression levels, catalytic rates, permeability of carboxysome shell) for efficient carbon fixation. Efficiency requires saturating the RuBisCO reaction, staying below saturation for carbonic anhydrase, and avoiding wasteful oxygenation reactions. We find selectivity at the carboxysome shell is not necessary; there is an optimal non-specific carboxysome shell permeability. We compare the efficacy of facilitated CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, CO<sub>2</sub> scavenging, and <inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula> transport with varying external pH. At the optimal carboxysome permeability, contributions from CO<sub>2</sub> scavenging at the cell membrane are small. We examine the cumulative benefits of CCM spatial organization strategies: enzyme co-localization and compartmentalization.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02043"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02043"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02043","entryfile":"elife-02043-v2.xml","files":["elife-02043-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02043-v1.xml"]}
