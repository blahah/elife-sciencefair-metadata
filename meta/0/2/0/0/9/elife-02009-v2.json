Here, we compare the transport of soluble secretory proteins (albumin and α1-antitrypsin) with that of supramolecular cargoes (e.g., procollagen) that are proposed to traverse the Golgi by compartment progression–maturation. We show that these soluble proteins traverse the Golgi much faster than procollagen while moving through the same stack. Moreover, we present kinetic and morphological observations that indicate that albumin transport occurs by diffusion via intercisternal continuities. These data provide evidence for a transport mechanism that applies to a major class of secretory proteins and indicate the co-existence of multiple intra-Golgi trafficking modes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02009"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02009"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02009","entryfile":"elife-02009-v2.xml","files":["elife-02009-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02009-v1.xml"]}
