Here, we study the regulatory potential of MYST1-(MOF)-containing MSL and NSL complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitors. We find that both complexes influence transcription by targeting promoters and TSS-distal enhancers. In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not exclusively enriched on the X chromosome, yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it specifically regulates <italic>Tsix</italic>, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion leads to decreased <italic>Tsix</italic> expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently, enhanced accumulation of <italic>Xist</italic> and variable numbers of inactivated X chromosomes during early differentiation. The NSL complex provides additional, <italic>Tsix</italic>-independent repression of <italic>Xist</italic> by maintaining pluripotency. MSL and NSL complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02024"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02024"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02024","entryfile":"elife-02024-v2.xml","files":["elife-02024-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02024-v1.xml"]}
