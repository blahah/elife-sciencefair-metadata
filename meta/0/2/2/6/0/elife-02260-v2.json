{"title":"A neural mechanism of speed-accuracy tradeoff in macaque area LIP","author":[{"surname":"Hanks","given-names":"Timothy"},{"surname":"Kiani","given-names":"Roozbeh"},{"surname":"Shadlen","given-names":"Michael N"}],"abstract":"Decision making often involves a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Previous studies indicate that neural activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) represents the gradual accumulation of evidence toward a threshold level, or evidence bound, which terminates the decision process. The level of this bound is hypothesized to mediate the speed-accuracy tradeoff. To test this, we recorded from LIP while monkeys performed a motion discrimination task in two speed-accuracy regimes. Surprisingly, the terminating threshold levels of neural activity were similar in both regimes. However, neurons recorded in the faster regime exhibited stronger evidence-independent activation from the beginning of decision formation, effectively reducing the evidence-dependent neural modulation needed for choice commitment. Our results suggest that control of speed vs accuracy may be exerted through changes in decision-related neural activity itself rather than through changes in the threshold applied to such neural activity to terminate a decision.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02260"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02260"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02260","entryfile":"elife-02260-v2.xml","files":["elife-02260-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02260-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02260-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02260-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02260-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02260-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02260-v1.xml"]}
