Breathing, for example, involves the sequential activation of numerous muscles hypothesized to be driven by a primary respiratory oscillator, the preBÃ¶tzinger Complex, and at least one other as-yet unidentified rhythmogenic population. We tested the roles of <italic>Atoh1-</italic>, <italic>Phox2b-</italic>, and <italic>Dbx1-</italic>derived neurons (three groups that have known roles in respiration) in the generation and coordination of respiratory output. We found that <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived neurons are necessary for all respiratory behaviors, whereas independent but coupled respiratory rhythms persist from at least three different motor pools after eliminating or silencing <italic>Phox2b-</italic> or <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing hindbrain neurons. Without <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons, however, the motor pools become temporally disorganized and coupling between independent respiratory oscillators decreases. We propose <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons tune the sequential activation of independent oscillators essential for the fine control of different muscles during breathing.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02265"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02265"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02265","entryfile":"elife-02265-v2.xml","files":["elife-02265-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02265-v1.xml"]}
