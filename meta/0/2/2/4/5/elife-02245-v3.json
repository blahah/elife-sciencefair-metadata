{"title":"Hidden shift of the ionome of plants exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> depletes minerals at the base of human nutrition","author":[{"surname":"Loladze","given-names":"Irakli"}],"abstract":"Mineral malnutrition stemming from undiversified plant-based diets is a top global challenge. In C<sub>3</sub> plants (e.g., rice, wheat), elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO<sub>2</sub>) reduce protein and nitrogen concentrations, and can increase the total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC; mainly starch, sugars). However, contradictory findings have obscured the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on the ionome—the mineral and trace-element composition—of plants. Consequently, CO<sub>2</sub>-induced shifts in plant quality have been ignored in the estimation of the impact of global change on humans. This study shows that eCO<sub>2</sub> reduces the overall mineral concentrations (−8%, 95% confidence interval: −9.1 to −6.9, p<0.00001) and increases TNC:minerals > carbon:minerals in C<sub>3</sub> plants. The meta-analysis of 7761 observations, including 2264 observations at state of the art FACE centers, covers 130 species/cultivars. The attained statistical power reveals that the shift is systemic and global. Its potential to exacerbate the prevalence of ‘hidden hunger’ and obesity is discussed.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02245"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02245"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02245","entryfile":"elife-02245-v3.xml","files":["elife-02245-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-02245-v1.xml","elife-02245-v2.xml"]}
