{"title":"Ribosomal protein S27-like is a physiological regulator of p53 that suppresses genomic instability and tumorigenesis","author":[{"surname":"Xiong","given-names":"Xiufang"},{"surname":"Zhao","given-names":"Yongchao"},{"surname":"Tang","given-names":"Fei"},{"surname":"Wei","given-names":"Dongping"},{"surname":"Thomas","given-names":"Daffyd"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Xiang"},{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Yang"},{"surname":"Zheng","given-names":"Pan"},{"surname":"Sun","given-names":"Yi"}],"abstract":"Cell-based studies showed that several Mdm2-binding ribosomal proteins, upon overexpression, stabilize and activate p53. In contrast, here we show in a mouse knockout study that Mdm2-binding ribosomal protein S27-like (Rps27l), upon disruption, activates p53. Germline inactivation of <italic>Rps27l</italic> triggers ribosomal stress to stabilize Mdm2, which degrades Mdm4 to reduce Mdm2-Mdm4 E3 ligase towards p53, leading to p53-dependent apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and postnatal death, which is rescued by <italic>Trp53</italic> deletion. Paradoxically, while increased p53 is expected to inhibit tumorigenesis, <italic>Rps27l</italic><sup>undefined</sup><italic>;Trp53</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mice develop lymphomas at higher incidence with p53 loss-of-heterozygosity and severe genome aneuploidy, suggesting that <italic>Rps27l</italic> disruption impose a selection pressure against p53. Thus, Rps27l has dual functions in p53 regulation: under <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>undefined</sup> background, <italic>Rps27l</italic> disruption triggers ribosomal stress to induce p53 and apoptosis, whereas under <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>undefined</sup> background, <italic>Rps27l</italic> disruption triggers genomic instability and <italic>Trp53</italic> deletion to promote tumorigenesis. Our study provides a new paradigm of p53 regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02236"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02236"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"08","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"02236","entryfile":"elife-02236-v2.xml","files":["elife-02236-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02236-v1.xml"]}
