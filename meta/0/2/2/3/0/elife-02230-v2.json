So far, most studies have focused on how fast TFs diffuse, underestimating the role of nuclear architecture. We implemented a single-molecule tracking assay to determine TFs dynamics. We found that c-Myc is a global explorer of the nucleus. In contrast, the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb is a local explorer that oversamples its environment. Consequently, each c-Myc molecule is equally available for all nuclear sites while P-TEFb reaches its targets in a position-dependent manner. Our observations are consistent with a model in which the exploration geometry of TFs is restrained by their interactions with nuclear structures and not by exclusion. The geometry-controlled kinetics of TFs target-search illustrates the influence of nuclear architecture on gene regulation, and has strong implications on how proteins react in the nucleus and how their function can be regulated in space and time.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02230"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02230"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02230","entryfile":"elife-02230-v2.xml","files":["elife-02230-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02230-v1.xml"]}
