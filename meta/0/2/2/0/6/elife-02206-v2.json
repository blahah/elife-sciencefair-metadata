{"title":"Natural variation reveals that intracellular distribution of ELF3 protein is associated with function in the circadian clock","author":[{"surname":"Anwer","given-names":"Muhammad Usman"},{"surname":"Boikoglou","given-names":"Eleni"},{"surname":"Herrero","given-names":"Eva"},{"surname":"Hallstein","given-names":"Marc"},{"surname":"Davis","given-names":"Amanda Melaragno"},{"surname":"Velikkakam James","given-names":"Geo"},{"surname":"Nagy","given-names":"Ferenc"},{"surname":"Davis","given-names":"Seth Jon"}],"abstract":"Natural selection of variants within the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> circadian clock can be attributed to adaptation to varying environments. To define a basis for such variation, we examined clock speed in a reporter-modified Bay-0 x Shakdara recombinant inbred line and localized heritable variation. Extensive variation led us to identify <italic>EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3)</italic> as a major quantitative trait locus (QTL). The causal nucleotide polymorphism caused a short-period phenotype under light and severely dampened rhythm generation in darkness, and entrainment alterations resulted. We found that ELF3-Sha protein failed to properly localize to the nucleus, and its ability to accumulate in darkness was compromised. Evidence was provided that the <italic>ELF3-Sha</italic> allele originated in Central Asia. Collectively, we showed that ELF3 protein plays a vital role in defining its light-repressor action in the circadian clock and that its functional abilities are largely dependent on its cellular localization.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02206"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02206"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02206","entryfile":"elife-02206-v2.xml","files":["elife-02206-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02206-v1.xml"]}
