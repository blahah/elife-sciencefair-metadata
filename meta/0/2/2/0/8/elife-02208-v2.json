Biochemical studies suggest that Spc110 facilitates higher-order γ-tubulin complex assembly (<xref>Kollman et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless the molecular basis for this activity and the regulation are unclear. Here we show that Spc110 phosphorylated by Mps1 and Cdk1 activates γ-TuSC oligomerization and MT nucleation in a cell cycle dependent manner. Interaction between the N-terminus of the γ-TuSC subunit Spc98 and Spc110 is important for this activity. Besides the conserved CM1 motif in γ-TuCRs (<xref>Sawin et al., 2004</xref>), a second motif that we named Spc110/Pcp1 motif (SPM) is also important for MT nucleation. The activating Mps1 and Cdk1 sites lie between SPM and CM1 motifs. Most organisms have both SPM-CM1 (Spc110/Pcp1/PCNT) and CM1-only (Spc72/Mto1/Cnn/CDK5RAP2/myomegalin) types of γ-TuCRs. The two types of γ-TuCRs contain distinct but conserved C-terminal MTOC targeting domains.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"02208"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.02208"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"02208","entryfile":"elife-02208-v2.xml","files":["elife-02208-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-02208-v1.xml"]}
