{"title":"Unified pre- and postsynaptic long-term plasticity enables reliable and flexible learning","author":[{"surname":"Costa","given-names":"Rui Ponte"},{"surname":"Froemke","given-names":"Robert C"},{"surname":"Sjöström","given-names":"P Jesper"},{"surname":"van Rossum","given-names":"Mark CW"}],"abstract":"Although it is well known that long-term synaptic plasticity can be expressed both pre- and postsynaptically, the functional consequences of this arrangement have remained elusive. We show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity with both pre- and postsynaptic expression develops receptive fields with reduced variability and improved discriminability compared to postsynaptic plasticity alone. These long-term modifications in receptive field statistics match recent sensory perception experiments. Moreover, learning with this form of plasticity leaves a hidden postsynaptic memory trace that enables fast relearning of previously stored information, providing a cellular substrate for memory savings. Our results reveal essential roles for presynaptic plasticity that are missed when only postsynaptic expression of long-term plasticity is considered, and suggest an experience-dependent distribution of pre- and postsynaptic strength changes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09457"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09457"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09457","entryfile":"elife-09457-v3.xml","files":["elife-09457-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09457-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09457-v1.xml","elife-09457-v2.xml"]}
