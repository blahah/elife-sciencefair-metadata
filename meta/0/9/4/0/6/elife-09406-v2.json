The most severely affected dilated cardiomyopathy patients harbor Titin truncations in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein, suggesting that mutation position might influence disease mechanism. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated six zebrafish lines with Titin truncations in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Although all exons were constitutive, C-terminal mutations caused severe myopathy whereas N-terminal mutations demonstrated mild phenotypes. Surprisingly, neither mutation type acted as a dominant negative. Instead, we found a conserved internal promoter at the precise position where divergence in disease severity occurs, with the resulting protein product partially rescuing N-terminal truncations. In addition to its clinical implications, our work may shed light on a long-standing mystery regarding the architecture of the sarcomere.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09406"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09406"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09406","entryfile":"elife-09406-v2.xml","files":["elife-09406-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09406-v1.xml"]}
