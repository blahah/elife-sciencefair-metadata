Here, we show that evolution along the fungal lineage was punctuated by the early acquisition and entrainment of the SBF transcription factor through horizontal gene transfer. Cell cycle evolution in the fungal ancestor then proceeded through a hybrid network containing both SBF and its ancestral animal counterpart E2F, which is still maintained in many basal fungi. We hypothesize that a virally-derived SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control by activating transcription via the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09492"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09492"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09492","entryfile":"elife-09492-v1.xml","files":["elife-09492-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09492-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
