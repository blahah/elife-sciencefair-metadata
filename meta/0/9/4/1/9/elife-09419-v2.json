In Xuanwei City of Yunnan Province, the lung cancer incidence is among the highest in China, attributed to smoky coal combustion-generated PAH pollution. Here, we screened for abnormal inflammatory factors in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) from Xuanwei and control regions (CR) where smoky coal was not used, and found that a chemokine CXCL13 was overexpressed in 63/70 (90%) of Xuanwei NSCLCs and 44/71 (62%) of smoker and 27/60 (45%) of non-smoker CR patients. CXCL13 overexpression was associated with the region Xuanwei and cigarette smoke. The key carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced CXCL13 production in lung epithelial cells and in mice prior to development of detectable lung cancer. Deficiency in Cxcl13 or its receptor, Cxcr5, significantly attenuated BaP-induced lung cancer in mice, demonstrating CXCL13â€™s critical role in PAH-induced lung carcinogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09419"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09419"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09419","entryfile":"elife-09419-v2.xml","files":["elife-09419-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09419-v1.xml"]}
