Here, analysis of mouse models revealed that <italic>let-7</italic>, a large and ancient microRNA family, performs tumor suppressive roles at the expense of regeneration. Too little or too much <italic>let-7</italic> resulted in compromised protection against cancer or tissue damage, respectively. Modest <italic>let-7</italic> overexpression abrogated <italic>MYC</italic>-driven liver cancer by antagonizing multiple <italic>let-7</italic> sensitive oncogenes. However, the same level of overexpression blocked liver regeneration, while <italic>let-7</italic> deletion enhanced it, demonstrating that distinct <italic>let-7</italic> levels can mediate desirable phenotypes. <italic>let-7</italic> dependent regeneration phenotypes resulted from influences on the insulin-PI3K-mTOR pathway. We found that chronic high-dose <italic>let-7</italic> overexpression caused liver damage and degeneration, paradoxically leading to tumorigenesis. These dose-dependent roles for <italic>let-7</italic> in tissue repair and tumorigenesis rationalize the tight regulation of this microRNA in development, and have important implications for <italic>let-7</italic> based therapeutics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09431"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09431"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09431","entryfile":"elife-09431-v2.xml","files":["elife-09431-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09431-v1.xml"]}
