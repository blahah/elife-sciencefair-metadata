{"title":"An extrafollicular pathway for the generation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells driven by the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-12","author":[{"surname":"Shah","given-names":"Suhagi"},{"surname":"Grotenbreg","given-names":"Gijsbert M"},{"surname":"Rivera","given-names":"Amariliz"},{"surname":"Yap","given-names":"George S"}],"abstract":"The proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 drives the generation of terminally differentiated KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Using a <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> vaccination model, we delineate the sequence of events that naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo to become terminal effectors and the differentiation steps controlled by IL-12. We demonstrate that direct IL-12 signaling on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is essential for the induction of KLRG1 and IFN-γ, but the subsequent downregulation of CXCR3 is controlled by IL-12 indirectly through the actions of IFN-γ and IFN-γ-inducible chemokines. Differentiation of nascent effectors occurs in an extrafollicular splenic compartment and is driven by late IL-12 production by DCs distinct from the classical CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC. Unexpectedly, we also found extensive proliferation of both KLRG1<sup>−</sup> and KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the marginal zone and red pulp, which ceases prior to the final KLRG1<sup>Hi</sup> CXCR3<sup>Lo</sup> stage. Our findings highlight the notion of an extrafollicular pathway for effector T cell generation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09017"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09017"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09017","entryfile":"elife-09017-v2.xml","files":["elife-09017-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09017-v1.xml"]}
