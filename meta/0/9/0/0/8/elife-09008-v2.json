Using genome-wide nucleosome mapping, we show that CTD S2 phosphorylation controls nucleosome dynamics in the promoter of a subset of 324 genes, including the regulators of cell differentiation <italic>ste11</italic> and metabolic adaptation <italic>inv1</italic>. Mechanistic studies on these genes indicate that during gene activation a local increase of phospho-S2 CTD nearby the promoter impairs the phospho-S5 CTD-dependent recruitment of Set1 and the subsequent recruitment of specific HDACs, which leads to nucleosome depletion and efficient transcription. The early increase of phospho-S2 results from the phosphorylation of the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 by MAP kinase in response to cellular signalling. The artificial tethering of the Lsk1 kinase at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter is sufficient to activate transcription. Therefore, signalling through the CTD code regulates promoter nucleosomes dynamics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09008"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09008"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09008","entryfile":"elife-09008-v2.xml","files":["elife-09008-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09008-v1.xml"]}
