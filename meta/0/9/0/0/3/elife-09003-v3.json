However, non-toxic chemical tools that modulate sumoylation in cells are lacking. Here, to identify small molecule sumoylation inhibitors we developed a cell-based screen that focused on the well-sumoylated substrate, human Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (hLRH-1, NR5A2). Our primary gene-expression screen assayed two SUMO-sensitive transcripts, <italic>APOC3</italic> and <italic>MUC1</italic>, that are upregulated by SUMO-less hLRH-1 or by siUBC9 knockdown, respectively. A polyphenol, tannic acid (TA) emerged as a potent sumoylation inhibitor in vitro (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.8 ÂµM) and in cells. TA also increased hLRH-1 occupancy on SUMO-sensitive transcripts. Most significantly, when tested in humanized mouse primary hepatocytes, TA inhibits hLRH-1 sumoylation and induces SUMO-sensitive genes, thereby recapitulating the effects of expressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 in mouse liver. Our findings underscore the benefits of phenotypic screening for targeting post-translational modifications, and illustrate the potential utility of TA for probing the cellular consequences of sumoylation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09003"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09003"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09003","entryfile":"elife-09003-v3.xml","files":["elife-09003-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09003-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09003-v1.xml","elife-09003-v2.xml"]}
