They control embryonic development and adult stem cell compartments, and their dysregulation often causes cancer. β-catenin-dependent transcription relies on the NPF motif of Pygo proteins. Here, we use a proteomics approach to discover the Chip/LDB-SSDP (ChiLS) complex as the ligand specifically binding to NPF. ChiLS also recognizes NPF motifs in other nuclear factors including Runt/RUNX2 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ARID1, and binds to Groucho/TLE. Studies of Wnt-responsive dTCF enhancers in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic midgut indicate how these factors interact to form the Wnt enhanceosome, primed for Wnt responses by Pygo. Together with previous evidence, our study indicates that ChiLS confers context-dependence on TCF/LEF by integrating multiple inputs from lineage and signal-responsive factors, including enhanceosome switch-off by Notch. Its pivotal function in embryos and stem cells explain why its integrity is crucial in the avoidance of cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09073"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09073"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09073","entryfile":"elife-09073-v2.xml","files":["elife-09073-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09073-v1.xml"]}
