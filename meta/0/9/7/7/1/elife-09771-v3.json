The current paradigm of characterizing synthetic networks in cells results in lengthy design-build-test cycles, minimal data collection, and poor quantitative characterization. Cell-free systems are appealing alternative environments, but it remains questionable whether biological networks behave similarly in cell-free systems and in cells. We characterized in a cell-free system the ‘repressilator’, a three-node synthetic oscillator. We then engineered novel three, four, and five-gene ring architectures, from characterization of circuit components to rapid analysis of complete networks. When implemented in cells, our novel 3-node networks produced population-wide oscillations and 95% of 5-node oscillator cells oscillated for up to 72 hr. Oscillation periods in cells matched the cell-free system results for all networks tested. An alternate forward engineering paradigm using cell-free systems can thus accurately capture cellular behavior.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09771"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09771"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09771","entryfile":"elife-09771-v3.xml","files":["elife-09771-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig4-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09771-v1.xml","elife-09771-v2.xml"]}
