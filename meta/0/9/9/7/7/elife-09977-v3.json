{"title":"Fast turnover of genome transcription across evolutionary time exposes entire non-coding DNA to <italic>de novo</italic> gene emergence","author":[{"surname":"Neme","given-names":"Rafik"},{"surname":"Tautz","given-names":"Diethard"}],"abstract":"Deep sequencing analyses have shown that a large fraction of genomes is transcribed, but the significance of this transcription is much debated. Here, we characterize the phylogenetic turnover of poly-adenylated transcripts in a comprehensive sampling of taxa of the mouse (genus <italic>Mus</italic>), spanning a phylogenetic distance of 10 Myr. Using deep RNA sequencing we find that at a given sequencing depth transcriptome coverage becomes saturated within a taxon, but keeps extending when compared between taxa, even at this very shallow phylogenetic level. Our data show a high turnover of transcriptional states between taxa and that no major transcript-free islands exist across evolutionary time. This suggests that the entire genome can be transcribed into poly-adenylated RNA when viewed at an evolutionary time scale. We conclude that any part of the non-coding genome can potentially become subject to evolutionary functionalization via <italic>de novo</italic> gene evolution within relatively short evolutionary time spans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09977"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09977"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09977","entryfile":"elife-09977-v3.xml","files":["elife-09977-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-app1-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-app1-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-app1-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09977-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09977-v1.xml","elife-09977-v2.xml"]}
