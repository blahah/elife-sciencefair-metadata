Complementary auxotrophs of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> amino acid and nucleotide metabolism regularly fail to compensate for each other's deficiencies upon co-culturing, a situation which implied the absence of growth-relevant metabolite exchange interactions. Contrastingly, we find that yeast colonies maintain a rich exometabolome and that cells prefer the uptake of extracellular metabolites over self-synthesis, indicators of ongoing metabolite exchange. We conceived a system that circumvents co-culturing and begins with a self-supporting cell that grows autonomously into a heterogeneous community, only able to survive by exchanging histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine. Compensating for the progressive loss of prototrophy, self-establishing communities successfully obtained an auxotrophic composition in a nutrition-dependent manner, maintaining a wild-type like exometabolome, growth parameters, and cell viability. Yeast, as a eukaryotic model, thus possesses extensive capacity for growth-relevant metabolite exchange and readily cooperates in metabolism within progressively establishing communities.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09943"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09943"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09943","entryfile":"elife-09943-v2.xml","files":["elife-09943-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09943-v1.xml"]}
