Trans-tight junction flux has been measured across large epithelial surfaces, but conductance across individual channels has never been measured. We report a novel trans-tight junction patch clamp technique that detects flux across individual claudin-2 channels within the tight junction of cultured canine renal tubule or human intestinal epithelial monolayers. In both cells, claudin-2 channels display conductances of ~90 pS. The channels are gated, strictly dependent on claudin-2 expression, and display size- and charge-selectivity typical of claudin-2. Kinetic analyses indicate one open and two distinct closed states. Conductance is symmetrical and reversible, characteristic of a passive, paracellular process, and blocked by reduced temperature or site-directed mutagenesis and chemical derivatization of the claudin-2 pore. We conclude that claudin-2 forms gated paracellular channels and speculate that modulation of tight junction channel gating kinetics may be an unappreciated mechanism of barrier regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09906"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09906"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09906","entryfile":"elife-09906-v2.xml","files":["elife-09906-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09906-v1.xml"]}
