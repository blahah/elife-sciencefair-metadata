We developed a Bayesian model using data from 102 national surveys, triangulated against delivery data and distribution reports, to generate year-by-year estimates of four ITN coverage indicators. We explored the impact of two potential 'inefficiencies': uneven net distribution among households and rapid rates of net loss from households. We estimated that, in 2013, 21% (17%–26%) of ITNs were over-allocated and this has worsened over time as overall net provision has increased. We estimated that rates of ITN loss from households are more rapid than previously thought, with 50% lost after 23 (20–28) months. We predict that the current estimate of 920 million additional ITNs required to achieve universal coverage would in reality yield a lower level of coverage (77% population access). By improving efficiency, however, the 920 million ITNs could yield population access as high as 95%.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09672"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09672"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"09672","entryfile":"elife-09672-v3.xml","files":["elife-09672-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-app1-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09672-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09672-v1.xml","elife-09672-v2.xml"]}
