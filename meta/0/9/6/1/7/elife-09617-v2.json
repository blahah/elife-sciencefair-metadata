We sought to determine whether, like tapasin, TAPBPR can also influence MHC class I peptide selection by functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst. We show that TAPBPR can catalyse the dissociation of peptides from peptide-MHC I complexes, enhance the loading of peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, and discriminate between peptides based on affinity in vitro. In cells, the depletion of TAPBPR increased the diversity of peptides presented on MHC I molecules, suggesting that TAPBPR is involved in restricting peptide presentation. Our results suggest TAPBPR binds to MHC I in a peptide-receptive state and, like tapasin, works to enhance peptide optimisation. It is now clear there are two MHC class I specific peptide editors, tapasin and TAPBPR, intimately involved in controlling peptide presentation to the immune system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09617"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09617"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09617","entryfile":"elife-09617-v2.xml","files":["elife-09617-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09617-v1.xml"]}
