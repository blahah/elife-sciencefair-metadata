{"title":"Multipotent versus differentiated cell fate selection in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> airways","author":[{"surname":"Matsuda","given-names":"Ryo"},{"surname":"Hosono","given-names":"Chie"},{"surname":"Samakovlis","given-names":"Christos"},{"surname":"Saigo","given-names":"Kaoru"}],"abstract":"Developmental potentials of cells are tightly controlled at multiple levels. The embryonic <italic>Drosophila</italic> airway tree is roughly subdivided into two types of cells with distinct developmental potentials: a proximally located group of multipotent adult precursor cells (P-fate) and a distally located population of more differentiated cells (D-fate). We show that the GATA-family transcription factor (TF) Grain promotes the P-fate and the POU-homeobox TF Ventral veinless (Vvl/Drifter/U-turned) stimulates the D-fate. Hedgehog and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling cooperate with Vvl to drive the D-fate at the expense of the P-fate while negative regulators of either of these signaling pathways ensure P-fate specification. Local concentrations of Decapentaplegic/BMP, Wingless/Wnt, and Hedgehog signals differentially regulate the expression of D-factors and P-factors to transform an equipotent primordial field into a concentric pattern of radially different morphogenetic potentials, which gradually gives rise to the distal-proximal organization of distinct cell types in the mature airway.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09646"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09646"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09646","entryfile":"elife-09646-v2.xml","files":["elife-09646-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09646-v1.xml"]}
