{"title":"RNA binding protein Caprin-2 is a pivotal regulator of the central osmotic defense response","author":[{"surname":"Konopacka","given-names":"Agnieszka"},{"surname":"Greenwood","given-names":"Mingkwan"},{"surname":"Loh","given-names":"Su-Yi"},{"surname":"Paton","given-names":"Julian"},{"surname":"Murphy","given-names":"David"}],"abstract":"In response to an osmotic challenge, the synthesis of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) increases in the hypothalamus, and this is accompanied by extension of the 3â€² poly(A) tail of the AVP mRNA, and the up-regulation of the expression of RNA binding protein Caprin-2. Here we show that Caprin-2 binds to AVP mRNAs, and that lentiviral mediated shRNA knockdown of Caprin-2 in the osmotically stimulated hypothalamus shortens the AVP mRNA poly(A) tail at the same time as reducing transcript abundance. In a recapitulated in vitro system, we confirm that Caprin-2 over-expression enhances AVP mRNA abundance and poly(A) tail length. Importantly, we show that Caprin-2 knockdown in the hypothalamus decreases urine output and fluid intake, and increases urine osmolality, urine sodium concentration, and plasma AVP levels. Thus Caprin-2 controls physiological mechanisms that are essential for the body's response to osmotic stress.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09656"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09656"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09656","entryfile":"elife-09656-v1.xml","files":["elife-09656-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09656-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
