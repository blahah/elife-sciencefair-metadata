Approximately 1550 specimens of hominin remains have been recovered from at least 15 individuals, representing a small portion of the total fossil content. Macro-vertebrate fossils are exclusively <italic>H. naledi</italic>, and occur within clay-rich sediments derived from in situ weathering, and exogenous clay and silt, which entered the chamber through fractures that prevented passage of coarser-grained material. The chamber was always in the dark zone, and not accessible to non-hominins. Bone taphonomy indicates that hominin individuals reached the chamber complete, with disarticulation occurring during/after deposition. Hominins accumulated over time as older laminated mudstone units and sediment along the cave floor were eroded. Preliminary evidence is consistent with deliberate body disposal in a single location, by a hominin species other than <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, at an as-yet unknown date.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09561"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09561"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09561","entryfile":"elife-09561-v1.xml","files":["elife-09561-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09561-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
