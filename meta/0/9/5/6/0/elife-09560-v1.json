This species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of <italic>H. naledi</italic> is unique, but most similar to early <italic>Homo</italic> species including <italic>Homo erectus</italic>, <italic>Homo habilis</italic> or <italic>Homo rudolfensis</italic>. While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. <italic>H. naledi</italic> has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominins yet discovered in Africa.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09560"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09560"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09560","entryfile":"elife-09560-v1.xml","files":["elife-09560-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig16-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig17-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig18-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig19-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig20-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig21-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig22-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09560-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
