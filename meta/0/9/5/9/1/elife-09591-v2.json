However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined. We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) that accumulate in <italic>dcl3</italic> mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity, also demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09591"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09591"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09591","entryfile":"elife-09591-v2.xml","files":["elife-09591-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09591-v1.xml"]}
