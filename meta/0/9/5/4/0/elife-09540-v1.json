However, their function remains largely elusive. Here, we show that Nup98-HoxA9, a fusion between Nup98 and the homeobox transcription factor HoxA9, forms nuclear aggregates that frequently associate with facultative heterochromatin. We demonstrate that stable expression of Nup98-HoxA9 in mouse embryonic stem cells selectively induces the expression of <italic>Hox</italic> cluster genes. Genome-wide binding site analysis revealed that Nup98-HoxA9 is preferentially targeted and accumulated at <italic>Hox</italic> cluster regions where the export factor Crm1 is originally prebound. In addition, leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1, disassembled nuclear Nup98-HoxA9 dots, resulting in the loss of chromatin binding of Nup98-HoxA9 and Nup98-HoxA9-mediated activation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Collectively, our results indicate that highly selective targeting of Nup98-fusion proteins to <italic>Hox</italic> cluster regions via prebound Crm1 induces the formation of higher order chromatin structures that causes aberrant <italic>Hox</italic> gene regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09540"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09540"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09540","entryfile":"elife-09540-v1.xml","files":["elife-09540-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig7-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09540-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
