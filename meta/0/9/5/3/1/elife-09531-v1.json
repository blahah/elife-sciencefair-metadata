However, the mechanisms by which projection neurons acquire their final properties during postnatal stages are still poorly understood. In this study, we show that the number of neurons co-expressing Ctip2 and Satb2, respectively involved in the early specification of subcerebral and callosal projection neurons, progressively increases after birth in the somatosensory cortex. Ctip2/Satb2 postnatal co-localization defines two distinct neuronal subclasses projecting either to the contralateral cortex or to the brainstem suggesting that Ctip2/Satb2 co-expression may refine their properties rather than determine their identity. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches reveal that the transcriptional adaptor Lmo4 drives this maturation program through modulation of epigenetic mechanisms in a time- and area-specific manner, thereby indicating that a previously unknown genetic program postnatally promotes the acquisition of final subtype-specific features.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09531"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09531"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09531","entryfile":"elife-09531-v1.xml","files":["elife-09531-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09531-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
