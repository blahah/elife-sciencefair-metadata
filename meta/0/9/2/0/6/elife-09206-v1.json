In this report, we demonstrate that actomyosin contractility and planar cell polarity (PCP) interact in post-mitotic <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells to self-assemble and reposition actomyosin rings, which play an essential role for cell elongation. Intriguingly, rings always form at the cellsâ€² anterior edge before migrating towards the center as contractility increases, reflecting a novel dynamical property of the cortex. Our drug and genetic manipulations uncover a tug-of-war between contractility, which localizes cortical flows toward the equator and PCP, which tries to reposition them. We develop a simple model of the physical forces underlying this tug-of-war, which quantitatively reproduces our results. We thus propose a quantitative framework for dissecting the relative contribution of contractility and PCP to the self-assembly and repositioning of cytoskeletal structures, which should be applicable to other morphogenetic events.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09206"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09206"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09206","entryfile":"elife-09206-v1.xml","files":["elife-09206-app3-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app4-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app4-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app4-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app5-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app5-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app5-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app5-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app5-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app5-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-app5-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09206-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
