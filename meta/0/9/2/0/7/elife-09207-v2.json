In prostate cancer, structural genomic rearrangements are a common mechanism driving tumorigenesis. However, somatic alterations predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements in prostate cancer remain largely undefined. Here, we show that <italic>SPOP</italic>, the most commonly mutated gene in primary prostate cancer modulates DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, and that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation is associated with genomic instability. In vivo, <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation results in a transcriptional response consistent with <italic>BRCA1</italic> inactivation resulting in impaired homology-directed repair (HDR) of DSB. Furthermore, we found that SPOP mutation sensitizes to DNA damaging therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors. These results implicate SPOP as a novel participant in DSB repair, suggest that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation drives prostate tumorigenesis in part through genomic instability, and indicate that mutant <italic>SPOP</italic> may increase response to DNA-damaging therapeutics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09207"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09207"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09207","entryfile":"elife-09207-v2.xml","files":["elife-09207-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09207-v1.xml"]}
