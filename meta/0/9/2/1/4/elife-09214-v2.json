However, the mechanisms driving such atypical gene expression programs are incompletely understood. Here, our transcriptional profiling of a cohort of 50 primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that transcription read-through beyond the termination site is a source of transcriptome diversity in cancer cells. Amongst the genes most frequently mutated in ccRCC, we identified <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation as a potent enhancer of transcription read-through. We further show that invasion of neighbouring genes and generation of RNA chimeras are functional outcomes of transcription read-through. We identified the <italic>BCL2</italic> oncogene as one of such invaded genes and detected a novel chimera, the <italic>CTSC-RAB38,</italic> in 20% of ccRCC samples. Collectively, our data highlight a novel link between transcription read-through and aberrant expression of oncogenes and chimeric transcripts that is prevalent in cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09214"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09214"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09214","entryfile":"elife-09214-v2.xml","files":["elife-09214-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09214-v1.xml"]}
