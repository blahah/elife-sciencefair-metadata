However, network-level mechanisms that link its activity to brain state remain enigmatic. Here, we combined optogenetics, fMRI, electrophysiology, and video-EEG monitoring to characterize the central thalamus-driven global brain networks responsible for switching brain state. 40 and 100 Hz stimulations of central thalamus caused widespread activation of forebrain, including frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and striatum, and transitioned the brain to a state of arousal in asleep rats. In contrast, 10 Hz stimulation evoked significantly less activation of forebrain, inhibition of sensory cortex, and behavioral arrest. To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the frequency-dependent cortical inhibition, we performed recordings in zona incerta, where 10, but not 40, Hz stimulation evoked spindle-like oscillations. Importantly, suppressing incertal activity during 10 Hz central thalamus stimulation reduced the evoked cortical inhibition. These findings identify key brain-wide dynamics underlying central thalamus arousal regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09215"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09215"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09215","entryfile":"elife-09215-v1.xml","files":["elife-09215-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09215-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
