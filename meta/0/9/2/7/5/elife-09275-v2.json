Morphine inhibits GABA inhibitory neurons, which shifts the balance between inhibitory and excitatory input to VTA-DA neurons in favor of excitation and then leads to VTA-DA neuron excitation. However, it is not known whether morphine has an additional strengthening effect on excitatory input. Our results suggest that glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons is inhibited by GABAergic interneurons via GABAB receptors and that morphine promotes presynaptic glutamate release by removing this inhibition. We also studied the contribution of the morphine-induced disinhibitory effect on the presynaptic glutamate release to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons and related behavior. Our results suggest that the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release might be the main mechanism for morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09275"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09275"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09275","entryfile":"elife-09275-v2.xml","files":["elife-09275-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09275-v1.xml"]}
