{"title":"Spontaneous neurotransmission signals through store-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to maintain synaptic homeostasis","author":[{"surname":"Reese","given-names":"Austin L"},{"surname":"Kavalali","given-names":"Ege T"}],"abstract":"Spontaneous glutamate release-driven NMDA receptor activity exerts a strong influence on synaptic homeostasis. However, the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that mediate this effect remain unclear. Here, using hippocampal neurons labeled with the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes Fluo-4 or GCAMP5, we visualized action potential-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in dendritic regions adjacent to fluorescently labeled presynaptic boutons in physiological levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients required NMDA receptor activity, and their propensity correlated with acute or genetically induced changes in spontaneous neurotransmitter release. In contrast, they were insensitive to blockers of AMPA receptors, L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, or group I mGluRs. However, inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release suppressed these transients and elicited synaptic scaling, a process which required protein translation and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase activity. These results support a critical role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in amplifying NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at rest for the maintenance of synaptic homeostasis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09262"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09262"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09262","entryfile":"elife-09262-v2.xml","files":["elife-09262-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09262-v1.xml"]}
