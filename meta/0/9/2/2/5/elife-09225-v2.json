{"title":"A simple method for generating high-resolution maps of genome-wide protein binding","author":[{"surname":"Skene","given-names":"Peter J"},{"surname":"Henikoff","given-names":"Steven"}],"abstract":"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and its derivatives are the main techniques used to determine transcription factor binding sites. However, conventional ChIP with sequencing (ChIP-seq) has problems with poor resolution, and newer techniques require significant experimental alterations and complex bioinformatics. Previously, we have used a new crosslinking ChIP-seq protocol (X-ChIP-seq) to perform high-resolution mapping of RNA Polymerase II (<xref>Skene et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we build upon this work and compare X-ChIP-seq to existing methodologies. By using micrococcal nuclease, which has both endo- and exo-nuclease activity, to fragment the chromatin and thereby generate precise proteinâ€“DNA footprints, high-resolution X-ChIP-seq achieves single base-pair resolution of transcription factor binding. A significant advantage of this protocol is the minimal alteration to the conventional ChIP-seq workflow and simple bioinformatic processing.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09225"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09225"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09225","entryfile":"elife-09225-v2.xml","files":["elife-09225-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09225-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09225-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09225-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09225-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09225-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09225-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09225-v1.xml"]}
