Vertebrate ALK has been considered to be an orphan receptor and the identity of the ALK ligand(s) is a critical issue. Here we show that FAM150A and FAM150B are potent ligands for human ALK that bind to the extracellular domain of ALK and in addition to activation of wild-type ALK are able to drive 'superactivation' of activated ALK mutants from neuroblastoma. In conclusion, our data show that ALK is robustly activated by the FAM150A/B ligands and provide an opportunity to develop ALK-targeted therapies in situations where ALK is overexpressed/activated or mutated in the context of the full length receptor.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09811"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09811"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09811","entryfile":"elife-09811-v2.xml","files":["elife-09811-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09811-v1.xml"]}
