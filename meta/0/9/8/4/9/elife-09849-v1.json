To examine the extent to which these oscillations reflect neuron engagement in distinct local circuit processes that are important for memory, we recorded single cell and local field potential activity from the CA1 region of the hippocampus as rats performed a context-guided odor-reward association task. We found that theta (4–12 Hz), beta (15–35 Hz), low gamma (35–55 Hz), and high gamma (65–90 Hz) frequencies exhibited dynamic amplitude profiles as rats sampled odor cues. Interneurons and principal cells exhibited unique engagement in each of the four rhythmic circuits in a manner that related to successful performance of the task. Moreover, principal cells coherent to each rhythm differentially represented task dimensions. These results demonstrate that distinct processing states arise from the engagement of rhythmically identifiable circuits, which have unique roles in organizing task-relevant processing in the hippocampus.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09849"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09849"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09849","entryfile":"elife-09849-v1.xml","files":["elife-09849-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09849-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
