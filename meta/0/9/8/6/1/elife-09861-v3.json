We quantified variation in CHC profiles in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and identified novel CHCs. We used principal component (PC) analysis to extract PCs that explain the majority of CHC variation and identified polymorphisms in or near 305 and 173 genes in females and males, respectively, associated with variation in these PCs. In addition, 17 DGRP lines contain the functional <italic>Desat2</italic> allele characteristic of African and Caribbean <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females (more 5,9-C27:2 and less 7,11-C27:2, female sex pheromone isomers). Disruption of expression of 24 candidate genes affected CHC composition in at least one sex. These genes are associated with fatty acid metabolism and represent mechanistic targets for individual variation in CHC composition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09861"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09861"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09861","entryfile":"elife-09861-v3.xml","files":["elife-09861-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp11-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp12-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp13-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp14-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp15-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp16-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp17-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp18-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp19-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp20-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp21-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp22-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp23-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp24-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-figsupp9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09861-v1.xml","elife-09861-v2.xml"]}
