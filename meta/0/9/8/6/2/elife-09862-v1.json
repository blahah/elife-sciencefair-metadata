How incoming sensorimotor information is channeled and communicated between these anatomical modules is still poorly understood. In this study, we used transgenic mice expressing GFP in specific subsets of Purkinje cells that allowed us to target a given set of cerebellar modules. Combining in vitro recordings and photostimulation, we identified stereotyped patterns of functional synaptic organization between the granule cell layer and its main targets, the Purkinje cells, Golgi cells and molecular layer interneurons. Each type of connection displayed position-specific patterns of granule cell synaptic inputs that do not strictly match with anatomical boundaries but connect distant cortical modules. Although these patterns can be adjusted by activity-dependent processes, they were found to be consistent and predictable between animals. Our results highlight the operational rules underlying communication between modules in the cerebellar cortex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09862"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09862"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09862","entryfile":"elife-09862-v1.xml","files":["elife-09862-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09862-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
