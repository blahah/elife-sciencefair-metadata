{"title":"Dna2 nuclease-helicase structure, mechanism and regulation by Rpa","author":[{"surname":"Zhou","given-names":"Chun"},{"surname":"Pourmal","given-names":"Sergei"},{"surname":"Pavletich","given-names":"Nikola P"}],"abstract":"The Dna2 nuclease-helicase maintains genomic integrity by processing DNA double-strand breaks, Okazaki fragments and stalled replication forks. Dna2 requires ssDNA ends, and is dependent on the ssDNA-binding protein Rpa, which controls cleavage polarity. Here we present the 2.3 Å structure of intact mouse Dna2 bound to a 15-nucleotide ssDNA. The nuclease active site is embedded in a long, narrow tunnel through which the DNA has to thread. The helicase domain is required for DNA binding but not threading. We also present the structure of a flexibly-tethered Dna2-Rpa interaction that recruits Dna2 to Rpa-coated DNA. We establish that a second Dna2-Rpa interaction is mutually exclusive with Rpa-DNA interactions and mediates the displacement of Rpa from ssDNA. This interaction occurs at the nuclease tunnel entrance and the 5’ end of the Rpa-DNA complex. Hence, it only displaces Rpa from the 5’ but not 3’ end, explaining how Rpa regulates cleavage polarity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09832"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09832"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09832","entryfile":"elife-09832-v3.xml","files":["elife-09832-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09832-v1.xml","elife-09832-v2.xml"]}
