{"title":"Mathematical modeling of the West Africa Ebola epidemic","author":[{"surname":"Chretien","given-names":"Jean-Paul"},{"surname":"Riley","given-names":"Steven"},{"surname":"George","given-names":"Dylan B"}],"abstract":"As of November 2015, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic that began in West Africa in late 2013 is waning. The human toll includes more than 28,000 EVD cases and 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the most heavily-affected countries. We reviewed 66 mathematical modeling studies of the EVD epidemic published in the peer-reviewed literature to assess the key uncertainties models addressed, data used for modeling, public sharing of data and results, and model performance. Based on the review, we suggest steps to improve the use of modeling in future public health emergencies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09186"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09186"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09186","entryfile":"elife-09186-v2.xml","files":["elife-09186-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09186-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09186-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09186-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09186-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09186-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09186-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09186-v1.xml"]}
