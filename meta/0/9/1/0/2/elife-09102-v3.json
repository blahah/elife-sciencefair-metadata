However, the complete repertoire of their roles is not yet identified. The embryonic NG2<sup>+</sup> glia originate from the Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> progenitors of the ventral telencephalon. Our analysis unravels that, beginning from E12.5 until E16.5, the NG2<sup>+</sup> glia populate the entire dorsal telencephalon. Interestingly, their appearance temporally coincides with the establishment of blood vessel network in the embryonic brain. NG2<sup>+</sup> glia are closely apposed to developing cerebral vessels by being either positioned at the sprouting tip cells or tethered along the vessel walls. Absence of NG2<sup>+</sup> glia drastically affects the vascular development leading to severe reduction of ramifications and connections by E18.5. By revealing a novel and fundamental role for NG2<sup>+</sup> glia, our study brings new perspectives to mechanisms underlying proper vessels network formation in embryonic brains.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09102"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09102"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09102","entryfile":"elife-09102-v3.xml","files":["elife-09102-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09102-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-09102-v1.xml","elife-09102-v2.xml"]}
