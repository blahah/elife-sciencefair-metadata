Here, we demonstrate how spectral confocal microscopy, typically reserved for fluorescent imaging, can be used to visualize metal-labeled tissues. This imaging does not involve the reflectance of metal particles, but rather the excitation of silver (or gold) nanoparticles and their putative surface plasmon resonance. To induce such resonance, silver or gold particles were excited with visible-wavelength laser lines (561 or 640 nm), and the maximal emission signal was collected at a shorter wavelength (i.e., higher energy state). Because the surface plasmon resonances of noble metal nanoparticles offer a superior optical signal and do not photobleach, our novel protocol holds enormous promise of a rebirth and further development of silver- and gold-based cell labeling protocols.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09388"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09388"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09388","entryfile":"elife-09388-v1.xml","files":["elife-09388-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09388-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09388-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09388-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09388-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-09388-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
