However, little is known about the involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice grown under phosphate starvation and recovery conditions, we identified widespread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements (TEs) close to highly induced genes. These changes in mC occurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly <italic>DCL3a</italic>-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, however no evidence of meiotic transmission was observed. Similar analyses performed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> revealed a very limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs in proximity to environmentally induced genes are silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in response to stress.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09343"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09343"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09343","entryfile":"elife-09343-v2.xml","files":["elife-09343-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09343-v1.xml"]}
