{"title":"Establishing the role of ATP for the function of the RIG-I innate immune sensor","author":[{"surname":"Rawling","given-names":"David C"},{"surname":"Fitzgerald","given-names":"Megan E"},{"surname":"Pyle","given-names":"Anna Marie"}],"abstract":"Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) initiates a rapid innate immune response upon detection and binding to viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). This signal activation occurs only when pathogenic RNA is identified, despite the ability of RIG-I to bind endogenous RNA while surveying the cytoplasm. Here we show that ATP binding and hydrolysis by RIG-I play a key role in the identification of viral targets and the activation of signaling. Using biochemical and cell-based assays together with mutagenesis, we show that ATP binding, and not hydrolysis, is required for RIG-I signaling on viral RNA. However, we show that ATP hydrolysis does provide an important function by recycling RIG-I and promoting its dissociation from non-pathogenic RNA. This activity provides a valuable proof-reading mechanism that enhances specificity and prevents an antiviral response upon encounter with host RNA molecules.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"09391"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.09391"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"09391","entryfile":"elife-09391-v2.xml","files":["elife-09391-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-09391-v1.xml"]}
