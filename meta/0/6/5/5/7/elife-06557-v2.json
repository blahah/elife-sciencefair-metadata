Here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride (TG) secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. Mice lacking <italic>Lpcat3</italic> in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma TGs. Mice lacking <italic>Lpcat3</italic> in the liver show reduced plasma TGs, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lacking arachidonoyl PLs. Mechanistic studies indicate that Lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl PLs in lipidating lipoprotein particles. These data identify Lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06557"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06557"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06557","entryfile":"elife-06557-v2.xml","files":["elife-06557-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06557-v1.xml"]}
