Norrin (Norrie Disease Protein) is a cystine-knot like growth factor. Although unrelated to Wnt, Norrin activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Signal complex formation involves Frizzled4 (Fz4), low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5/6 (Lrp5/6), Tetraspanin-12 and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Here, we report crystallographic and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses of Norrin in complex with Fz4 cysteine-rich domain (Fz4<sub>CRD</sub>), of this complex bound with GAG analogues, and of unliganded Norrin and Fz4<sub>CRD</sub>. Our structural, biophysical and cellular data, map Fz4 and putative Lrp5/6 binding sites to distinct patches on Norrin, and reveal a GAG binding site spanning Norrin and Fz4<sub>CRD</sub>. These results explain numerous disease-associated mutations. Comparison with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt8–mouse Fz8<sub>CRD</sub> complex reveals Norrin mimics Wnt for Frizzled recognition. The production and characterization of wild-type and mutant Norrins reported here open new avenues for the development of therapeutics to combat abnormal Norrin/Wnt signalling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06554"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06554"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06554","entryfile":"elife-06554-v1.xml","files":["elife-06554-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06554-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
