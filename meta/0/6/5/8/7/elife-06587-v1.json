Here we report that the female gametophyte-expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) LORELEI and the seedling-expressed LRE-like GPI-AP1 (LLG1) bind to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of FER and show that this interaction is pivotal for FER function. LLG1 interacts with FER in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the cell surface, and loss of LLG1 function induces cytoplasmic retention of FER, consistent with transport of FER from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in a complex with LLG1. We further demonstrate that LLG1 is a component of the FER-regulated RHO GTPase signaling complex and that <italic>fer</italic> and <italic>llg1</italic> mutants display indistinguishable growth, developmental and signaling phenotypes, analogous to how <italic>lre</italic> and <italic>fer</italic> share similar reproductive defects. Together our results support LLG1/LRE acting as a chaperone and co-receptor for FER and elucidate a mechanism by which GPI-APs enable the signaling capacity of a cell surface receptor.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06587"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06587"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06587","entryfile":"elife-06587-v1.xml","files":["elife-06587-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig10-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06587-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
