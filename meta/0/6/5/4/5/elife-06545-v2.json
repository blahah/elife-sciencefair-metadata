This arrangement is the result of coordinated cell movements, cell shape changes, and the organisation of pigment cells during metamorphosis. Iridophores play a crucial part in this process by switching between the dense form of the light stripes and the loose form of the dark stripes. Adult <italic>schachbrett</italic> (<italic>sbr</italic>) mutants exhibit delayed changes in iridophore shape and organisation caused by truncations in Tight Junction Protein 1a (ZO-1a). In <italic>sbr</italic> mutants, the dark stripes are interrupted by dense iridophores invading as coherent sheets. Immuno-labelling and chimeric analyses indicate that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores but down-regulated in the loose form. Tjp1a is a novel regulator of cell shape changes during colour pattern formation and the first cytoplasmic protein implicated in this process.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06545"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06545"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06545","entryfile":"elife-06545-v2.xml","files":["elife-06545-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06545-v1.xml"]}
