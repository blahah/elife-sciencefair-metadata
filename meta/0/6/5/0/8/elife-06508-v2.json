Perforin-2 is expressed constitutively in phagocytes and inducibly in parenchymal, tissue-forming cells. In vitro, Perforin-2 prevents the intracellular replication and proliferation of bacterial pathogens in these cells. Perforin-2 knockout mice are unable to control the systemic dissemination of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) or <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and perish shortly after epicutaneous or orogastric infection respectively. In contrast, Perforin-2-sufficient littermates clear the infection. Perforin-2 is a transmembrane protein of cytosolic vesicles -derived from multiple organelles- that translocate to and fuse with bacterium containing vesicles. Subsequently, Perforin-2 polymerizes and forms large clusters of 100 Ã… pores in the bacterial surface with Perforin-2 cleavage products present in bacteria. Perforin-2 is also required for the bactericidal activity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and hydrolytic enzymes. Perforin-2 constitutes a novel and apparently essential bactericidal effector molecule of the innate immune system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06508"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06508"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06508","entryfile":"elife-06508-v2.xml","files":["elife-06508-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06508-v1.xml"]}
