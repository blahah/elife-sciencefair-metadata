Although considerable interest exists in CDK9 as a therapeutic target, little progress has been made due to lack of highly selective inhibitors. Here, we describe the development of i-CDK9 as such an inhibitor that potently suppresses CDK9 phosphorylation of substrates and causes genome-wide Pol II pausing. While most genes experience reduced expression, MYC and other primary response genes increase expression upon sustained i-CDK9 treatment. Essential for this increase, the bromodomain protein BRD4 captures P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP to deliver to target genes and also enhances CDK9's activity and resistance to inhibition. Because the i-CDK9-induced MYC expression and binding to P-TEFb compensate for P-TEFb's loss of activity, only simultaneously inhibiting CDK9 and MYC/BRD4 can efficiently induce growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, suggesting the potential of a combinatorial treatment strategy.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06535"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06535"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06535","entryfile":"elife-06535-v2.xml","files":["elife-06535-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06535-v1.xml"]}
