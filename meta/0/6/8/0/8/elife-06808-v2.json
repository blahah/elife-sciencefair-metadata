Mechanistic understanding of branching is largely limited to flowering plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which have a recent evolutionary origin. We show that in gametophytic shoots of <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, lateral branches arise by re-specification of epidermal cells into branch initials. A simple model co-ordinating the activity of leafy shoot tips can account for branching patterns, and three known and ancient hormonal regulators of sporophytic branching interact to generate the branching pattern- auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone. The mode of auxin transport required in branch patterning is a key divergence point from known sporophytic pathways. Although PIN-mediated basipetal auxin transport regulates branching patterns in flowering plants, this is not so in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, where bi-directional transport is required to generate realistic branching patterns. Experiments with callose synthesis inhibitors suggest plasmodesmal connectivity as a potential mechanism for transport.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06808"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06808"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06808","entryfile":"elife-06808-v2.xml","files":["elife-06808-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06808-v1.xml"]}
