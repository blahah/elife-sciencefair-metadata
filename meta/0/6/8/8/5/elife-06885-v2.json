{"title":"Ngn1 inhibits astrogliogenesis through induction of miR-9 during neuronal fate specification","author":[{"surname":"Zhao","given-names":"Jing"},{"surname":"Lin","given-names":"Quan"},{"surname":"Kim","given-names":"Kevin J"},{"surname":"Dardashti","given-names":"Faranak D"},{"surname":"Kim","given-names":"Jennifer"},{"surname":"He","given-names":"Fei"},{"surname":"Sun","given-names":"Yi"}],"abstract":"It has been postulated that a proneural factor, neurogenin 1 (Ngn1), simultaneously activates the neurogenic program and inhibits the alternative astrogliogenic program when specifying the neuronal fate. While Ngn1 substantially suppresses the activation of the astrogliogenic Jak-Stat pathway, the underlying molecular mechanism was unknown. Here, by employing in vivo and in vitro approaches, we report that Ngn1 binds to the promoter of a brain-enriched microRNA, miR-9, and activates its expression during neurogenesis. Subsequently, our in vitro study showed that miR-9 directly targets mRNAs of <italic>Lifr-beta</italic>, <italic>Il6st (gp130)</italic>, and <italic>Jak1</italic> to down-regulate these critical upstream components of the Jak-Stat pathway, achieving inhibition of Stat phosphorylation and consequently, suppression of astrogliogenesis. This study revealed Ngn1 modulated non-coding RNA epigenetic regulation during cell fate specifications.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06885"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06885"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06885","entryfile":"elife-06885-v2.xml","files":["elife-06885-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06885-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06885-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06885-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06885-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06885-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06885-v1.xml"]}
