{"title":"<italic>Peromyscus</italic> mice as a model for studying natural variation","author":[{"surname":"Bedford","given-names":"Nicole L"},{"surname":"Hoekstra","given-names":"Hopi E"}],"abstract":"The deer mouse (genus <italic>Peromyscus</italic>) is the most abundant mammal in North America, and it occupies almost every type of terrestrial habitat. It is not surprising therefore that the natural history of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> is among the best studied of any small mammal. For decades, the deer mouse has contributed to our understanding of population genetics, disease ecology, longevity, endocrinology and behavior. Over a century's worth of detailed descriptive studies of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> in the wild, coupled with emerging genetic and genomic techniques, have now positioned these mice as model organisms for the study of natural variation and adaptation. Recent work, combining field observations and laboratory experiments, has lead to exciting advances in a number of fieldsâ€”from evolution and genetics, to physiology and neurobiology.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06813"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06813"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06813","entryfile":"elife-06813-v1.xml","files":["elife-06813-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06813-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06813-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06813-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
