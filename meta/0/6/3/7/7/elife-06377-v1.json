In this study, we describe an exception to this paradigm. TRIM33 is identified here as a lineage dependency in B cell neoplasms and is shown to perform this essential function by associating with a single <italic>cis</italic> element. ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in murine B cell leukemia revealed a preferential association with two lineage-specific enhancers that harbor an exceptional density of motifs recognized by the PU.1 TF. TRIM33 is recruited to these elements by PU.1, yet acts to antagonize PU.1 function. One of the PU.1/TRIM33 co-occupied enhancers is upstream of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bim</italic>, and deleting this enhancer renders TRIM33 dispensable for leukemia cell survival. These findings reveal an essential role for TRIM33 in preventing apoptosis in B lymphoblastic leukemia by interfering with enhancer-mediated <italic>Bim</italic> activation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06377"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06377"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06377","entryfile":"elife-06377-v1.xml","files":["elife-06377-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06377-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
