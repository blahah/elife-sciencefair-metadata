Here we identify a novel molecular mechanism by which IL-6 regulates CD4 cell effector function. We show that IL-6-dependent signal facilitates the formation of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes to sustain high mitochondrial membrane potential late during activation of CD4 cells. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization caused by IL-6 is uncoupled from the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. However, it is a mechanism to raise the levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> late during activation of CD4 cells. Increased levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of IL-6 are used to prolong <italic>Il4</italic> and <italic>Il21</italic> expression in effector CD4 cells. Thus, the effect of IL-6 on mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an alternative pathway by which IL-6 regulates effector function of CD4 cells and it could contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06376"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06376"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"06376","entryfile":"elife-06376-v2.xml","files":["elife-06376-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06376-v1.xml"]}
