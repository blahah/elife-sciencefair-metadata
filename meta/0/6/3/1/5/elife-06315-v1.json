Genome-level sequencing can overcome these complications. Extreme childhood phenotypes are promising candidates for new Mendelian traits. One example is early onset hypertension, a rare form of a global cause of morbidity and mortality. We performed exome sequencing of 40 unrelated subjects with hypertension due to primary aldosteronism by age 10. Five subjects (12.5%) shared the identical, previously unidentified, heterozygous <italic>CACNA1H</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mutation. Two mutations were demonstrated to be de novo events, and all mutations occurred independently. <italic>CACNA1H</italic> encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2) expressed in adrenal glomerulosa. CACNA1H<sup>M1549V</sup> showed drastically impaired channel inactivation and activation at more hyperpolarized potentials, producing increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the signal for aldosterone production. This mutation explains disease pathogenesis and provides new insight into mechanisms mediating aldosterone production and hypertension.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06315"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06315"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06315","entryfile":"elife-06315-v1.xml","files":["elife-06315-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06315-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
