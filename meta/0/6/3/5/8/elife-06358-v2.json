However, the mechanisms that control signal transmission at this synapse and its relevance to behavior remain poorly understood. In this study we used a genetic system to titrate the rate of GPCR signaling in ON-BC dendrites by varying the concentration of key RGS proteins and measuring the impact on transmission of signal between photoreceptors and ON-BC neurons using electroretinography and single cell recordings. We found that sensitivity, onset timing, and the maximal amplitude of light-evoked responses in rod- and cone-driven ON-BCs are determined by different RGS concentrations. We further show that changes in RGS concentration differentially impact visually guided-behavior mediated by rod and cone ON pathways. These findings illustrate that neuronal circuit properties can be modulated by adjusting parameters of GPCR-based neurotransmission at individual synapses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06358"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06358"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06358","entryfile":"elife-06358-v2.xml","files":["elife-06358-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06358-v1.xml"]}
