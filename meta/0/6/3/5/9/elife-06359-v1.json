{"title":"Asymmetric conformational maturation of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase","author":[{"surname":"Zheng","given-names":"Xunhai"},{"surname":"Perera","given-names":"Lalith"},{"surname":"Mueller","given-names":"Geoffrey A"},{"surname":"DeRose","given-names":"Eugene F"},{"surname":"London","given-names":"Robert E"}],"abstract":"HIV-1 reverse transcriptase utilizes a metamorphic polymerase domain that is able to adopt two alternate structures that fulfill catalytic and structural roles, thereby minimizing its coding requirements. This ambiguity introduces folding challenges that are met by a complex maturation process. We have investigated this conformational maturation using NMR studies of methyl-labeled RT for the slower processes in combination with molecular dynamics simulations for rapid processes. Starting from an inactive conformation, the p66 precursor undergoes a unimolecular isomerization to a structure similar to its active form, exposing a large hydrophobic surface that facilitates initial homodimer formation. The resulting p66/p66' homodimer exists as a conformational heterodimer, after which a series of conformational adjustments on different time scales can be observed. Formation of the inter-subunit RH:thumb' interface occurs at an early stage, while maturation of the connection' and unfolding of the RH' domains are linked and occur on a much slower time scale.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06359"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06359"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"06359","entryfile":"elife-06359-v1.xml","files":["elife-06359-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig8-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig8-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06359-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
