We modeled the larva's navigational decision to initiate turns as the output of a Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson cascade. We used reverse-correlation to fit parameters to this model; the parameterized model predicted larvae's responses to novel stimulus patterns. For multi-modal inputs, we found that larvae linearly combine olfactory and visual signals upstream of the decision to turn. We verified this prediction by measuring larvae's responses to coordinated changes in odor and light. We studied other navigational decisions and found that larvae integrated odor and light according to the same rule in all cases. These results suggest that photo-taxis and odor-taxis are mediated by a shared computational pathway.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06229"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06229"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06229","entryfile":"elife-06229-v2.xml","files":["elife-06229-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06229-v1.xml"]}
