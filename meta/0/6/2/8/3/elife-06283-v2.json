Herein, we found that <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown induced <italic>CDKN1A</italic> transcription and chromatin looping concurrently with Pol III recruitment. Simultaneous knockdown of <italic>MAF1</italic> with Pol III or <italic>BRF1</italic> (subunit of TFIIIB) diminished the activation and looping effect, which indicates that recruiting Pol III was required for activation of Pol II-mediated transcription and chromatin looping. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown indicated enhanced binding of Pol III and BRF1, as well as of CFP1, p300, and PCAF, which are factors that mediate active histone marks, along with the binding of TATA binding protein (TBP) and POLR2E to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter. Simultaneous knockdown with Pol III abolished these regulatory events. Similar results were obtained for <italic>GDF15</italic>. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which MAF1 and Pol III regulate the activity of a protein-coding gene transcribed by Pol II.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06283"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06283"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06283","entryfile":"elife-06283-v2.xml","files":["elife-06283-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06283-v1.xml"]}
