{"title":"The chromatin remodelers RSC and ISW1 display functional and chromatin-based promoter antagonism","author":[{"surname":"Parnell","given-names":"Timothy J"},{"surname":"Schlichter","given-names":"Alisha"},{"surname":"Wilson","given-names":"Boris G"},{"surname":"Cairns","given-names":"Bradley R"}],"abstract":"ISWI family chromatin remodelers typically organize nucleosome arrays, while SWI/SNF family remodelers (RSC) typically disorganize and eject nucleosomes, implying an antagonism that is largely unexplored in vivo. Here, we describe two independent genetic screens for <italic>rsc</italic> suppressors that yielded mutations in the promoter-focused ISW1a complex or mutations in the ‘basic patch’ of histone H4 (an epitope that regulates ISWI activity), strongly supporting RSC-ISW1a antagonism in vivo. RSC and ISW1a largely co-localize, and genomic nucleosome studies using <italic>rsc isw1</italic> mutant combinations revealed opposing functions: promoters classified with a nucleosome-deficient region (NDR) gain nucleosome occupancy in <italic>rsc</italic> mutants, but this gain is attenuated in <italic>rsc isw1</italic> double mutants. Furthermore, promoters lacking NDRs have the highest occupancy of both remodelers, consistent with regulation by nucleosome occupancy, and decreased transcription in <italic>rsc</italic> mutants. Taken together, we provide the first genetic and genomic evidence for RSC-ISW1a antagonism and reveal different mechanisms at two different promoter architectures.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06073"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06073"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06073","entryfile":"elife-06073-v2.xml","files":["elife-06073-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06073-v1.xml"]}
