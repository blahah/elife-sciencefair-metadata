Using gene disruption in the mouse, we discovered a function for a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor PDZ-RhoGEF (<italic>Arhgef11</italic>) in white adipose tissue biology. While PDZ-RhoGEF was dispensable for a number of RhoA signaling-mediated processes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, including stress fiber formation and cell migration, it's deletion led to a reduction in their proliferative potential. On a whole organism level, PDZ-RhoGEF deletion resulted in an acute increase in energy expenditure, selectively impaired early adipose tissue development and decreased adiposity in adults. PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient mice were protected from diet-induced obesity and T2D. Mechanistically, PDZ-RhoGEF enhanced insulin/IGF-1 signaling in adipose tissue by controlling ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Our results demonstrate that PDZ-RhoGEF acts as a key determinant of mammalian metabolism and obesity-associated pathologies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06011"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06011"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06011","entryfile":"elife-06011-v2.xml","files":["elife-06011-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06011-v1.xml"]}
