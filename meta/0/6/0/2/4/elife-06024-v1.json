{"title":"An organismal perspective on <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> development, origins and diversification","author":[{"surname":"Kourakis","given-names":"Matthew J"},{"surname":"Smith","given-names":"William C"}],"abstract":"The ascidian <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, commonly known as a ‘sea squirt’, has become an important model for embryological studies, offering a simple blueprint for chordate development. As a model organism, it offers the following: a small, compact genome; a free swimming larva with only about 2600 cells; and an embryogenesis that unfolds according to a predictable program of cell division. Moreover, recent phylogenies reveal that <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> occupies a privileged branch in the tree of life: it is our nearest invertebrate relative. Here, we provide an organismal perspective of <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>, highlighting aspects of its life history and habitat—from its brief journey as a larva to its radical metamorphosis into adult form—and relate these features to its utility as a laboratory model.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06024"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06024"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06024","entryfile":"elife-06024-v1.xml","files":["elife-06024-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
