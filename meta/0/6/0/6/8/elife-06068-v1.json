{"title":"Release of human cytomegalovirus from latency by a KAP1/TRIM28 phosphorylation switch","author":[{"surname":"Rauwel","given-names":"Benjamin"},{"surname":"Jang","given-names":"Suk Min"},{"surname":"Cassano","given-names":"Marco"},{"surname":"Kapopoulou","given-names":"Adamandia"},{"surname":"Barde","given-names":"Isabelle"},{"surname":"Trono","given-names":"Didier"}],"abstract":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a highly prevalent pathogen that induces life-long infections notably through the establishment of latency in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bouts of reactivation are normally controlled by the immune system, but can be fatal in immuno-compromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients. Here, we reveal that HCMV latency in human CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC reflects the recruitment on the viral genome of KAP1, a master co-repressor, together with HP1 and the SETDB1 histone methyltransferase, which results in transcriptional silencing. During lytic infection, KAP1 is still associated with the viral genome, but its heterochromatin-inducing activity is suppressed by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation. Correspondingly, HCMV can be forced out of latency by KAP1 knockdown or pharmacological induction of KAP1 phosphorylation, and this process can be potentiated by activating NFkB with TNF-Î±. These results suggest new approaches both to curtail CMV infection and to purge the virus from organ transplants.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06068"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06068"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06068","entryfile":"elife-06068-v1.xml","files":["elife-06068-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig6-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig6-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig8-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-resp-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06068-resp-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
