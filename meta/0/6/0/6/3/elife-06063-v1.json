Here we report that viewing the delivery of food to an unvisited portion of an environment leads to off-line pre-activation of place cells sequences corresponding to that space. Such ‘<italic>preplay</italic>’ was not observed for an unrewarded but otherwise similar portion of the environment. These results suggest that a hippocampal representation of a visible, yet unexplored environment can be formed if the environment is of motivational relevance to the animal. We hypothesise such goal-biased preplay may support preparation for future experiences in novel environments.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06063"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06063"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06063","entryfile":"elife-06063-v1.xml","files":["elife-06063-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06063-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
