Random segregation of an extra chromosome is predicted to result in a high frequency of trisomic offspring from a trisomic parent. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> with trisomy of the X chromosome, however, have far fewer trisomic offspring than expected. We found that the extra X chromosome was preferentially eliminated during anaphase I of female meiosis. We utilized a mutant with a specific defect in pairing of the X chromosome as a model to investigate the apparent bias against univalent inheritance. First, univalents lagged during anaphase I and their movement was biased toward the cortex and future polar body. Second, late-lagging univalents were frequently captured by the ingressing polar body contractile ring. The asymmetry of female meiosis can thus partially correct pre-existing trisomy.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06056"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06056"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06056","entryfile":"elife-06056-v2.xml","files":["elife-06056-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06056-v1.xml"]}
