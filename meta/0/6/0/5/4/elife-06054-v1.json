To test the hypothesis that deletion of gD-2 unmasks protective antigens, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of an HSV-2 virus deleted in gD-2 and complemented allowing a single round of replication on cells expressing HSV-1 gD (Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup>). Subcutaneous immunization of C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice with Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD1</sup> provided 100% protection against lethal intravaginal or skin challenges and prevented latency. Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD1</sup> elicited no disease in SCID mice, whereas 1000-fold lower doses of wild-type virus were lethal. HSV-specific antibodies were detected in serum (titer 1:800,000) following immunization and in vaginal washes after intravaginal challenge. The antibodies elicited cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but little neutralizing activity. Passive transfer of immune serum completely protected wild-type, but not Fcγ-receptor or neonatal Fc-receptor knock-out mice. These studies demonstrate that non-neutralizing Fc-mediated humoral responses confer protection and support advancement of this attenuated vaccine.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06054"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06054"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06054","entryfile":"elife-06054-v1.xml","files":["elife-06054-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06054-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
