However, identification of regulatory elements has been limited, as DNA-binding motifs are known for only 71 of the estimated 763 sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). To address this problem, we performed protein binding microarray experiments on representatives of canonical TF families in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, obtaining motifs for 129 TFs. Additionally, we predict motifs for many TFs that have DNA-binding domains similar to those already characterized, increasing coverage of binding specificities to 292 <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFs (âˆ¼40%). These data highlight the diversification of binding motifs for the nuclear hormone receptor and C2H2 zinc finger families and reveal unexpected diversity of motifs for T-box and DM families. Motif enrichment in promoters of functionally related genes is consistent with known biology and also identifies putative regulatory roles for unstudied TFs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06967"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06967"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06967","entryfile":"elife-06967-v2.xml","files":["elife-06967-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig8-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig8-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06967-v1.xml"]}
