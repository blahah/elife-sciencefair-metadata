However, little is known about the processing of taste pheromones in higher order brain centers. Here, we describe a male-specific gustatory circuit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that underlies the detection of the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone (3<italic>R</italic>,11<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>)-3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol (CH503). Using behavioral analysis, genetic manipulation, and live calcium imaging, we show that Gr68a-expressing neurons on the forelegs of male flies exhibit a sexually dimorphic physiological response to the pheromone and relay information to the central brain via peptidergic neurons. The release of tachykinin from 8 to 10 cells within the subesophageal zone is required for the pheromone-triggered courtship suppression. Taken together, this work describes a neuropeptide-modulated central brain circuit that underlies the programmed behavioral response to a gustatory sex pheromone. These results will allow further examination of the molecular basis by which innate behaviors are modulated by gustatory cues and physiological state.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06914"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06914"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06914","entryfile":"elife-06914-v2.xml","files":["elife-06914-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06914-v1.xml"]}
