Here we define conditions specifically enhancing Tfh differentiation and providing protection in a model of influenza infection. Tfh responses were associated with prolonged antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs), which maintained T cell/DC interactions into stage 3 (>72 hr) of activation. Blocking stage 3 interactions ablated Tfh generation, demonstrating a causal link between T cell-DC behaviour and functional outcomes. The current data therefore explain how duration of antigen presentation affects the dynamics of T cell-DC interactions and consequently determine Tfh cell differentiation in the developing immune response.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06994"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06994"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06994","entryfile":"elife-06994-v2.xml","files":["elife-06994-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06994-v1.xml"]}
