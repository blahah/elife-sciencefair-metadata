We here demonstrate axonal co-transport of BRP and RBP using intravital live imaging, with both proteins co-accumulating in axonal aggregates of several transport mutants. RBP, via its C-terminal Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains, binds Aplip1/JIP1, a transport adaptor involved in kinesin-dependent SV transport. We show in atomic detail that RBP C-terminal SH3 domains bind a proline-rich (PxxP) motif of Aplip1/JIP1 with submicromolar affinity. Pointmutating this PxxP motif provoked formation of ectopic AZ-like structures at axonal membranes. Direct interactions between AZ proteins and transport adaptors seem to provide complex avidity and shield synaptic interaction surfaces of pre-assembled scaffold protein transport complexes, thus, favouring physiological synaptic AZ assembly over premature assembly at axonal membranes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06935"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06935"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06935","entryfile":"elife-06935-v1.xml","files":["elife-06935-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06935-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
