A novel alternative strategy is to develop pigs that are genetically resistant to infection. Here, we produce transgenic (TG) pigs that constitutively expressed FMDV-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) derived from small hairpin RNA (shRNA). In vitro challenge of TG fibroblasts showed the shRNA suppressed viral growth. TG and non-TG pigs were challenged by intramuscular injection with 100 LD<sub>50</sub> of FMDV. High fever, severe clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease and typical histopathological changes were observed in all of the non-TG pigs but in none of the high-siRNA pigs. Our results show that TG shRNA can provide a viable tool for producing animals with enhanced resistance to FMDV.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06951"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06951"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06951","entryfile":"elife-06951-v2.xml","files":["elife-06951-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06951-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06951-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06951-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06951-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06951-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06951-v1.xml"]}
