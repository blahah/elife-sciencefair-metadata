This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Coadministration of a tumor-penetrating peptide enhances the efficacy of cancer drugs’ by Sugahara and colleagues, published in <italic>Science</italic> in 2010 (<xref>Sugahara et al., 2010</xref>). The key experiments being replicated include Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 9A. In Figure 2, Sugahara and colleagues presented data on the tumor penetrance of doxorubicin (DOX) when co-administered with the peptide iRGD, as well as the effect of co-treatment of DOX and iRGD on tumor weight and cell death. In Supplemental Figure 9A, they tracked body weight of mice treated with DOX and iRGD to provide evidence that iRGD does not increase known DOX toxicity. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06959"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06959"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06959","entryfile":"elife-06959-v1.xml","files":[]}
