It is presumed that these precursors integrate cortical networks where they act as sensors of neuronal activity. We show that NG2 cells of the developing somatosensory cortex form a transient and structured synaptic network with interneurons that follows its own rules of connectivity. Fast-spiking interneurons, highly connected to NG2 cells, target proximal subcellular domains containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with γ2 subunits. Conversely, non-fast-spiking interneurons, poorly connected with these progenitors, target distal sites lacking this subunit. In the network, interneuron-NG2 cell connectivity maps exhibit a local spatial arrangement reflecting innervation only by the nearest interneurons. This microcircuit architecture shows a connectivity peak at PN10, coinciding with a switch to massive oligodendrocyte differentiation. Hence, GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells is temporally and spatially regulated from the subcellular to the network level in coordination with the onset of oligodendrogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06953"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06953"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06953","entryfile":"elife-06953-v2.xml","files":["elife-06953-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06953-v1.xml"]}
