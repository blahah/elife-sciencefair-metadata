Recently, we identified an enrichment of liver X receptor alpha and beta (LXRα/β) in the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve. In this study, we show mice lacking LXRα/β in peripheral sensory neurons have increased energy expenditure and weight loss when fed a Western diet (WD). Our findings suggest that the ability to metabolize and sense cholesterol and/or fatty acids in peripheral neurons is an important requirement for physiological adaptations to WDs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06667"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06667"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06667","entryfile":"elife-06667-v1.xml","files":["elife-06667-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06667-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06667-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06667-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06667-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06667-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06667-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
