{"title":"Low cost, high performance processing of single particle cryo-electron microscopy data in the cloud","author":[{"surname":"Cianfrocco","given-names":"Michael A"},{"surname":"Leschziner","given-names":"Andres E"}],"abstract":"The advent of a new generation of electron microscopes and direct electron detectors has realized the potential of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as a technique to generate high-resolution structures. Calculating these structures requires high performance computing clusters, a resource that may be limiting to many likely cryo-EM users. To address this limitation and facilitate the spread of cryo-EM, we developed a publicly available ‘off-the-shelf’ computing environment on Amazon's elastic cloud computing infrastructure. This environment provides users with single particle cryo-EM software packages and the ability to create computing clusters with 16–480+ CPUs. We tested our computing environment using a publicly available 80S yeast ribosome dataset and estimate that laboratories could determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures for $50 to $1500 per structure within a timeframe comparable to local clusters. Our analysis shows that Amazon's cloud computing environment may offer a viable computing environment for cryo-EM.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06664"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06664"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06664","entryfile":"elife-06664-v2.xml","files":["elife-06664-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06664-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06664-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06664-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06664-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06664-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06664-v1.xml"]}
