Cyclic di-GMP (CDG) is a promising mucosal vaccine adjuvant. However, its in vivo mechanisms are unclear. Here, we showed, in mice, that CDG elicits stronger Ab and T<sub>H</sub> responses than the mammalian 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), and generated better protection against <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection than 2′3′-cGAMP adjuvanted vaccine. We identified two in vivo mechanisms of CDG. First, intranasally administered CDG greatly enhances Ag uptake, including pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis in vivo. The enhancement depends on MPYS (STING, MITA) expression in CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells. Second, we found that CDG selectively activated pinocytosis-efficient-DCs, leading to T<sub>H</sub> polarizing cytokines IL-12p70, IFNγ, IL-5, IL-13, IL-23, and IL-6 production in vivo. Notably, CDG induces IFNλ, but not IFNβ, in vivo. Our study revealed previously unrecognized in vivo functions of MPYS and advanced our understanding of CDG as a mucosal vaccine adjuvant.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06670"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06670"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06670","entryfile":"elife-06670-v2.xml","files":["elife-06670-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06670-v1.xml"]}
