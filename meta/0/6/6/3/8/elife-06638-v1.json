Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. To date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a ‘chemical harpoon’. This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions. This represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering beneficial interactions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06638"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06638"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06638","entryfile":"elife-06638-v1.xml","files":["elife-06638-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06638-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
