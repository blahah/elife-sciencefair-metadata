Here, we examine how signals experienced during free olfactory behaviors are processed by first-order olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. We find that OSNs can act as differentiators that transiently normalize stimulus intensityâ€”a property potentially derived from a combination of integral feedback and feed-forward regulation of olfactory transduction. In olfactory virtual reality experiments, we report that high activity levels of the OSN suppress turning, whereas low activity levels facilitate turning. Using a generalized linear model, we explain how peripheral encoding of olfactory stimuli modulates the probability of switching from a run to a turn. Our work clarifies the link between computations carried out at the sensory periphery and action selection underlying navigation in odor gradients.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06694"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06694"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06694","entryfile":"elife-06694-v1.xml","files":["elife-06694-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig16-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig17-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig18-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06694-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
