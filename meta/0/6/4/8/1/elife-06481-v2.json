{"title":"Recruitment of the default mode network during a demanding act of executive control","author":[{"surname":"Crittenden","given-names":"Ben M"},{"surname":"Mitchell","given-names":"Daniel J"},{"surname":"Duncan","given-names":"John"}],"abstract":"In the human brain, a default mode or task-negative network shows reduced activity during many cognitive tasks and is often associated with internally-directed processes, such as mind wandering and thoughts about the self. In contrast to this task-negative pattern, we show increased activity during a large and demanding switch in task set. Furthermore, we employ multivoxel pattern analysis and find that regions of interest within default mode network are encoding task-relevant information during task performance. Activity in this network may be driven by major revisions of cognitive context, whether internally or externally focused.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06481"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06481"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06481","entryfile":"elife-06481-v2.xml","files":["elife-06481-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06481-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06481-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06481-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06481-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06481-v1.xml"]}
