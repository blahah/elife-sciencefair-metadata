We addressed these questions at single-cell resolution in zebrafish embryos. We identify the GPI-anchored MMP inhibitor Reck and the adhesion GPCR Gpr124 as integral components of a Wnt7a/Wnt7b-specific signaling complex required for brain angiogenesis and dorsal root ganglia neurogenesis. We further show that this atypical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway selectively controls endothelial tip cell function and hence, that mosaic restoration of single wild-type tip cells in Wnt/β-catenin-deficient perineural vessels is sufficient to initiate the formation of CNS vessels. Our results identify molecular determinants of ligand specificity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and provide evidence for organ-specific control of vascular invasion through tight modulation of tip cell function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06489"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06489"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06489","entryfile":"elife-06489-v1.xml","files":["elife-06489-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06489-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
