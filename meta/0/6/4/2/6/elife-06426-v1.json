Studies in rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that EC can be divided into subregions that connect differentially with perirhinal cortex (PRC) vs parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and with hippocampal subfields along the proximo-distal axis. Here, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla to identify functional subdivisions of the human EC. In two independent datasets, PRC showed preferential intrinsic functional connectivity with anterior-lateral EC and PHC with posterior-medial EC. These EC subregions, in turn, exhibited differential connectivity with proximal and distal subiculum. In contrast, connectivity of PRC and PHC with subiculum followed not only a proximal-distal but also an anterior-posterior gradient. Our data provide the first evidence that the human EC can be divided into functional subdivisions whose functional connectivity closely parallels the known anatomical connectivity patterns of the rodent and nonhuman primate EC.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06426"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06426"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06426","entryfile":"elife-06426-v1.xml","files":["elife-06426-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06426-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
