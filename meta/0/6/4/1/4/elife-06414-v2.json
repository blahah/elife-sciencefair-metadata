Several channel types can mediate dendritically initiated spikes (dSpikes), which may impact information processing and storage across multiple timescales; however, the roles of different channels in the rapid vs long-term effects of dSpikes are unknown. We show here that dSpikes mediated by Na<sub>v</sub> channels (blocked by a low concentration of TTX) are required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the distal apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, imaging, simulations, and buffering experiments all support a model whereby fast Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated dSpikes (Na-dSpikes) contribute to LTP induction by promoting large, transient, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores of NMDAR and L-type Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Thus, in addition to contributing to rapid neural processing, Na-dSpikes are likely to contribute to memory formation via their role in long-lasting synaptic plasticity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06414"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06414"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06414","entryfile":"elife-06414-v2.xml","files":["elife-06414-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06414-v1.xml"]}
