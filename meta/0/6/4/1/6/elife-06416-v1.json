Limited genomic information shows that phage genomes are mosaic, and the genetic architecture of phage populations remains ill-defined. To understand the population structure of phages infecting a single host strain, we isolated, sequenced, and compared 627 phages of <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. Their genetic diversity is considerable, and there are 28 distinct genomic types (clusters) with related nucleotide sequences. However, amino acid sequence comparisons show pervasive genomic mosaicism, and quantification of inter-cluster and intra-cluster relatedness reveals a continuum of genetic diversity, albeit with uneven representation of different phages. Furthermore, rarefaction analysis shows that the mycobacteriophage population is not closed, and there is a constant influx of genes from other sources. Phage isolation and analysis was performed by a large consortium of academic institutions, illustrating the substantial benefits of a disseminated, structured program involving large numbers of freshman undergraduates in scientific discovery.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06416"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06416"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06416","entryfile":"elife-06416-v1.xml","files":["elife-06416-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06416-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
