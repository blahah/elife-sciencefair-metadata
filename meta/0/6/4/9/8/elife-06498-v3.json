In this study, we report the discovery of a novel patient selection strategy for the p53–HDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097, currently under evaluation in clinical trials. By intersecting high-throughput cell line sensitivity data with genomic data, we have identified a gene expression signature consisting of 13 up-regulated genes that predicts for sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 in both cell lines and in patient-derived tumor xenograft models. Interestingly, these 13 genes are known p53 downstream target genes, suggesting that the identified gene signature reflects the presence of at least a partially activated p53 pathway in NVP-CGM097-sensitive tumors. Together, our findings provide evidence for the use of this newly identified predictive gene signature to refine the selection of patients with wild-type p53 tumors and increase the likelihood of response to treatment with p53–HDM2 inhibitors, such as NVP-CGM097.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06498"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06498"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06498","entryfile":"elife-06498-v3.xml","files":["elife-06498-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06498-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-06498-v1.xml","elife-06498-v2.xml"]}
