The pre-replication complex protein, origin recognition complex-associated (ORCA/LRWD1), preferentially localizes to heterochromatic regions in post-replicated cells. Its role in heterochromatin organization remained elusive. ORCA recognizes methylated H3K9 marks and interacts with repressive KMTs, including G9a/GLP and Suv39H1 in a chromatin context-dependent manner. Single-molecule pull-down assays demonstrate that ORCA-ORC (Origin Recognition Complex) and multiple H3K9 KMTs exist in a single complex and that ORCA stabilizes H3K9 KMT complex. Cells lacking ORCA show alterations in chromatin architecture, with significantly reduced H3K9 di- and tri-methylation at specific chromatin sites. Changes in heterochromatin structure due to loss of ORCA affect replication timing, preferentially at the late-replicating regions. We demonstrate that ORCA acts as a scaffold for the establishment of H3K9 KMT complex and its association and activity at specific chromatin sites is crucial for the organization of heterochromatin structure.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06496"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06496"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06496","entryfile":"elife-06496-v2.xml","files":["elife-06496-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06496-v1.xml"]}
