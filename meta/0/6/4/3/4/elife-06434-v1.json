The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link>citations and Altimetric scores</ext-link> (<xref>Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘The microRNA miR-34a inhibits prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by directly repressing CD44’ by Liu and colleagues published in <italic>Nature Medicine</italic> in 2011 (<xref>Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Liu and colleagues first demonstrated that miR-34a levels were reduced in CD44+ prostate cancer cells (Figure 1B). They then showed that xenograft tumors from cells expressing exogenous miR-34a were smaller in size than control tumors (Supplemental Figure 5C). Tumors with exogenous miR-34a showed reduced levels of CD44 expression (Figure 4A), and mutation of two putative miR-34a binding sites in the CD33 3′ UTR partially abrogated signal repression in a luciferase assay (Figure 4D). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06434"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06434"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"07","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06434","entryfile":"elife-06434-v1.xml","files":[]}
