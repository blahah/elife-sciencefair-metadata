In characterizing early transcriptional changes following drug treatment of mutant EGFR-addicted cells, we identified the stem cell transcriptional regulator SOX2 as being rapidly and specifically induced, both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of SOX2 sensitizes cells to erlotinib-mediated apoptosis, ultimately decreasing the emergence of acquired resistance, whereas its ectopic expression reduces drug-induced cell death. We show that erlotinib relieves EGFR-dependent suppression of FOXO6, leading to its induction of SOX2, which in turn represses the pro-apoptotic BH3-only genes <italic>BIM</italic> and <italic>BMF</italic>. Together, these observations point to a physiological feedback mechanism that attenuates oncogene addiction-mediated cell death associated with the withdrawal of growth factor signaling and may therefore contribute to the development of resistance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06132"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06132"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"02","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06132","entryfile":"elife-06132-v2.xml","files":["elife-06132-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-06132-v1.xml"]}
