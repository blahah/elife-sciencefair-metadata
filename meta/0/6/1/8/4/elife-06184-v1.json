In this study, we report evidence of a significant correlation between the number of genes encoding the immunomodulatory CD33-related sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like receptors (CD33rSiglecs) and maximum lifespan in mammals. In keeping with this, we show that mice lacking Siglec-E, the main member of the CD33rSiglec family, exhibit reduced survival. Removal of Siglec-E causes the development of exaggerated signs of aging at the molecular, structural, and cognitive level. We found that accelerated aging was related both to an unbalanced ROS metabolism, and to a secondary impairment in detoxification of reactive molecules, ultimately leading to increased damage to cellular DNA, proteins, and lipids. Taken together, our data suggest that CD33rSiglecs co-evolved in mammals to achieve a better management of oxidative stress during inflammation, which in turn reduces molecular damage and extends lifespan.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06184"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06184"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"04","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06184","entryfile":"elife-06184-v1.xml","files":["elife-06184-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06184-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
