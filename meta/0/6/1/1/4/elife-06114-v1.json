{"title":"Myoblast cytonemes mediate Wg signaling from the wing imaginal disc and Delta-Notch signaling to the air sac primordium","author":[{"surname":"Huang","given-names":"Hai"},{"surname":"Kornberg","given-names":"Thomas B"}],"abstract":"The flight muscles, dorsal air sacs, wing blades, and thoracic cuticle of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult function in concert, and their progenitor cells develop together in the wing imaginal disc. The wing disc orchestrates dorsal air sac development by producing decapentaplegic and fibroblast growth factor that travel via specific cytonemes in order to signal to the air sac primordium (ASP). Here, we report that cytonemes also link flight muscle progenitors (myoblasts) to disc cells and to the ASP, enabling myoblasts to relay signaling between the disc and the ASP. Frizzled (Fz)-containing myoblast cytonemes take up Wingless (Wg) from the disc, and Delta (Dl)-containing myoblast cytonemes contribute to Notch activation in the ASP. Wg signaling negatively regulates Dl expression in the myoblasts. These results reveal an essential role for cytonemes in Wg and Notch signaling and for a signal relay system in the myoblasts.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06114"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06114"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"05","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06114","entryfile":"elife-06114-v1.xml","files":["elife-06114-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig11-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06114-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
