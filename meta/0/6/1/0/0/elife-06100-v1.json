{"title":"Planting molecular functions in an ecological context with <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Kr√§mer","given-names":"Ute"}],"abstract":"The vascular plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is a central genetic model and universal reference organism in plant and crop science. The successful integration of different fields of research in the study of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has made a large contribution to our molecular understanding of key concepts in biology. The availability and active development of experimental tools and resources, in combination with the accessibility of a wealth of cumulatively acquired knowledge about this plant, support the most advanced systems biology approaches among all land plants. Research in molecular ecology and evolution has also brought the natural history of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> into the limelight. This article showcases our current knowledge of the natural history of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> from the perspective of the most closely related plant species, providing an evolutionary framework for interpreting novel findings and for developing new hypotheses based on our knowledge of this plant.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06100"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06100"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06100","entryfile":"elife-06100-v1.xml","files":["elife-06100-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06100-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06100-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06100-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
