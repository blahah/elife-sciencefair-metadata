The yeast metalloprotease Wss1 clears chromatin-bound sumoylated proteins. Wss1 and its mammalian analog, DVC1/Spartan, belong to minigluzincins family of proteases. Wss1 proteolytic activity is regulated by a cysteine switch mechanism activated by chemical stress and/or DNA binding. Wss1 is required for cell survival following UV irradiation, the smt3-331 mutation and Camptothecin-induced formation of covalent topoisomerase 1 complexes (Top1cc). Wss1 forms a SUMO-specific ternary complex with the AAA ATPase Cdc48 and an adaptor, Doa1. Upon DNA damage Wss1/Cdc48/Doa1 is recruited to sumoylated targets and catalyzes SUMO chain extension through a newly recognized SUMO ligase activity. Activation of Wss1 results in metalloprotease self-cleavage and proteolysis of associated proteins. In cells lacking Tdp1, clearance of topoisomerase covalent complexes becomes SUMO and Wss1-dependent. Upon genotoxic stress, Wss1 is vacuolar, suggesting a link between genotoxic stress and autophagy involving the Doa1 adapter.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06763"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06763"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06763","entryfile":"elife-06763-v1.xml","files":["elife-06763-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06763-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
