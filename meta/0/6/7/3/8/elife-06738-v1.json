Here, we combine high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T with novel data-driven and model-based analyses to identify corresponding subregions in humans based on the well-known global connectivity fingerprints in rodents and sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial information. We provide evidence for a functional division primarily along the anteroposterior axis. Localising the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC has important implications for translating studies on the hippocampo-entorhinal memory system from rodents to humans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"06738"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.06738"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"06","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"06738","entryfile":"elife-06738-v1.xml","files":["elife-06738-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-06738-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
