The structural basis for Her2 heterodimerization, however, remains poorly understood. The unexpected recent finding of asymmetric ectodomain dimer structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR (dEGFR) suggests a possible structural basis for Her2 heterodimerization, but all available structures for dimers of human EGFR family ectodomains are symmetric. Here, we report results from long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations indicating that a single ligand is necessary and sufficient to stabilize the ectodomain interface of Her2 heterodimers, which assume an asymmetric conformation similar to that of dEGFR dimers. This structural parallelism suggests a dimerization mechanism that has been conserved in the evolution of the EGFR family from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to human.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00708"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00708"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00708","entryfile":"elife-00708-v1.xml","files":["elife-00708-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00708-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00708-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00708-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00708-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00708-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
