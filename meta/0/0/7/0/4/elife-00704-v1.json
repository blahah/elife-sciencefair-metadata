{"title":"<italic>MCU</italic> encodes the pore conducting mitochondrial calcium currents","author":[{"surname":"Chaudhuri","given-names":"Dipayan"},{"surname":"Sancak","given-names":"Yasemin"},{"surname":"Mootha","given-names":"Vamsi K"},{"surname":"Clapham","given-names":"David E"}],"abstract":"Mitochondrial calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) import is a well-described phenomenon regulating cell survival and ATP production. Of multiple pathways allowing such entry, the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter is a highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channel complex encoded by several recently-discovered genes. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunit remains to be established, since knockdown of all the candidate uniporter genes inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in imaging assays, and reconstitution experiments have been equivocal. To definitively identify the channel, we use whole-mitoplast voltage-clamping, the technique that originally established the uniporter as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. We show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <italic>mitochondrial calcium uniporter</italic> (<italic>MCU</italic>) gene reduces mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>undefined</sub>), whereas overexpression increases it. Additionally, a classic feature of <italic>I</italic><sub>undefined</sub>, its sensitivity to ruthenium red inhibition, can be abolished by a point mutation in the putative pore domain without altering current magnitude. These analyses establish that <italic>MCU</italic> encodes the pore-forming subunit of the uniporter channel.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00704"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00704"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00704","entryfile":"elife-00704-v1.xml","files":["elife-00704-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00704-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00704-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
