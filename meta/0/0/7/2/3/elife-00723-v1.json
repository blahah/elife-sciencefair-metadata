Previous ultrastructural studies of vesicle recycling were conducted in dissected preparations using an intense stimulation to maximize the probability of release. Here, a single light stimulus was applied to motor neurons in intact <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nematodes expressing channelrhodopsin, and the animals rapidly frozen. We found that docked vesicles fuse along a broad active zone in response to a single stimulus, and are replenished with a time constant of about 2 s. Endocytosis occurs within 50 ms adjacent to the dense projection and after 1 s adjacent to adherens junctions. These studies suggest that synaptic vesicle endocytosis may occur on a millisecond time scale following a single physiological stimulus in the intact nervous system and is unlikely to conform to current models of endocytosis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00723"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00723"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00723","entryfile":"elife-00723-v1.xml","files":["elife-00723-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00723-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
