Here, we used a protein microarray-based approach to systematically survey the entire human TF family and found numerous purified TFs with methylated CpG (mCpG)-dependent DNA-binding activities. Interestingly, some TFs exhibit specific binding activity to methylated and unmethylated DNA motifs of distinct sequences. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focused on Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and decoupled its mCpG- and CpG-binding activities via site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, KLF4 binds specific methylated or unmethylated motifs in human embryonic stem cells in vivo. Our study suggests that mCpG-dependent TF binding activity is a widespread phenomenon and provides a new framework to understand the role and mechanism of TFs in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00726"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00726"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00726","entryfile":"elife-00726-v1.xml","files":["elife-00726-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00726-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
