Until the late 1970s, <italic>P. infestans</italic> diversity outside of its Mexican center of origin was low, and one scenario held that a single strain, US-1, had dominated the global population for 150 years; this was later challenged based on DNA analysis of historical herbarium specimens. We have compared the genomes of 11 herbarium and 15 modern strains. We conclude that the 19th century epidemic was caused by a unique genotype, HERB-1, that persisted for over 50 years. HERB-1 is distinct from all examined modern strains, but it is a close relative of US-1, which replaced it outside of Mexico in the 20th century. We propose that HERB-1 and US-1 emerged from a metapopulation that was established in the early 1800s outside of the species' center of diversity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00731"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00731"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"05","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"00731","entryfile":"elife-00731-v1.xml","files":["elife-00731-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00731-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
