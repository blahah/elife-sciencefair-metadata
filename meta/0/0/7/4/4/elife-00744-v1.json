IFT has been implicated in sensory and motile ciliary functions, but the mechanisms of this relationship remain unclear. Here, we used <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellar surface motility (FSM) as a model to test whether IFT provides force for gliding of cells across solid surfaces. We show that IFT trains are coupled to flagellar membrane glycoproteins (FMGs) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. IFT trains transiently pause through surface adhesion of their FMG cargos, and dynein-1b motors pull the cell towards the distal tip of the axoneme. Each train is transported by at least four motors, with only one type of motor active at a time. Our results demonstrate the mechanism of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> gliding motility and suggest that IFT plays a major role in adhesion-induced ciliary signaling pathways.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00744"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00744"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00744","entryfile":"elife-00744-v1.xml","files":["elife-00744-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00744-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
