Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> injectisomes in situ and the first structural analysis of the <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisome. Unexpectedly, basal bodies of injectisomes inside the bacterial cells showed length variations of 20%. The in situ structures of the <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>S. flexneri</italic> injectisomes had similar dimensions and were significantly longer than the isolated structures of related injectisomes. The crystal structure of the inner membrane injectisome component YscD appeared elongated compared to a homologous protein, and molecular dynamics simulations documented its elongation elasticity. The ring-shaped secretin YscC at the outer membrane was stretched by 30–40% in situ, compared to its isolated liposome-embedded conformation. We suggest that elasticity is critical for some two-membrane spanning protein complexes to cope with variations in the intermembrane distance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00792"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00792"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00792","entryfile":"elife-00792-v1.xml","files":["elife-00792-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00792-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
