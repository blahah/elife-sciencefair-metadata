Here we utilize single-molecule observations of RNA in fixed and living cells to develop a single-cell model of steroid-receptor mediated gene activation. We determine that steroids drive mRNA synthesis by frequency modulation of transcription. This digital behavior in single cells gives rise to the well-known analog dose response across the population. To test this model, we developed a light-activation technology to turn on a single steroid-responsive gene and follow dynamic synthesis of RNA from the activated locus.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00750"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00750"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"00750","entryfile":"elife-00750-v1.xml","files":["elife-00750-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00750-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
