{"title":"EBI2-mediated bridging channel positioning supports splenic dendritic cell homeostasis and particulate antigen capture","author":[{"surname":"Yi","given-names":"Tangsheng"},{"surname":"Cyster","given-names":"Jason G"}],"abstract":"Splenic dendritic cells (DCs) present blood-borne antigens to lymphocytes to promote T cell and antibody responses. The cues involved in positioning DCs in areas of antigen exposure in the spleen are undefined. Here we show that CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs highly express EBI2 and migrate to its oxysterol ligand, 7α,25-OHC. In mice lacking EBI2 or the enzymes needed for generating normal distributions of 7α,25-OHC, CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are reduced in frequency and the remaining cells fail to situate in marginal zone bridging channels. The CD4<sup>+</sup> DC deficiency can be rescued by LTβR agonism. EBI2-mediated positioning in bridging channels promotes DC encounter with blood-borne particulate antigen. Upon exposure to antigen, CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs move rapidly to the T-B zone interface and promote induction of helper T cell and antibody responses. These findings establish an essential role for EBI2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> DC positioning and homeostasis and in facilitating capture and presentation of blood-borne particulate antigens.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00757"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00757"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"05","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00757","entryfile":"elife-00757-v1.xml","files":["elife-00757-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00757-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
