In metazoa, distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2α kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2α. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the ‘integrated stress response’ (ISR). eIF2α phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis, while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling, we identified a small molecule, named ISRIB, that potently (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2α phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably, ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus, memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR, and ISRIB releases this brake. As such, ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00498"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00498"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"05","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00498","entryfile":"elife-00498-v1.xml","files":["elife-00498-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00498-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
