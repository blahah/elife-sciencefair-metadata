Here, we demonstrate that the <italic>ClockΔ19</italic> mutant behavioral phenotype is significantly modified by mouse strain genetic background. We map a suppressor of the <italic>ClockΔ19</italic> mutation to a ∼900 kb interval on mouse chromosome 1 and identify the transcription factor, <italic>Usf1</italic>, as the responsible gene. A SNP in the promoter of <italic>Usf1</italic> causes elevation of its transcript and protein in strains that suppress the <italic>Clock</italic> mutant phenotype. USF1 competes with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex for binding to E-box sites in target genes. Saturation binding experiments demonstrate reduced affinity of the CLOCKΔ19:BMAL1 complex for E-box sites, thereby permitting increased USF1 occupancy on a genome-wide basis. We propose that USF1 is an important modulator of molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00426"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00426"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"04","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00426","entryfile":"elife-00426-v1.xml","files":["elife-00426-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00426-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
