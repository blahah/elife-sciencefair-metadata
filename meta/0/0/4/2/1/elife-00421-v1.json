Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) constitute a widespread group of defensive plant volatiles that convey a herbivory-specific message via their isomeric composition: feeding of the tobacco hornworm <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> converts (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- to (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs thereby attracting predatory insects. Here we show that this isomer-coded message is monitored by ovipositing <italic>M. sexta</italic> females. We detected the isomeric shift in the host plant <italic>Datura wrightii</italic> and performed functional imaging in the primary olfactory center of <italic>M. sexta</italic> females with GLV structural isomers. We identified two isomer-specific regions responding to either (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- or (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenyl acetate. Field experiments demonstrated that ovipositing <italic>Manduca</italic> moths preferred (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-perfumed <italic>D. wrightii</italic> over (<italic>E</italic>)-2-perfumed plants. These results show that (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs and/or specific (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratios provide information regarding host plant attack by conspecifics that ovipositing hawkmoths use for host plant selection.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00421"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00421"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"05","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00421","entryfile":"elife-00421-v1.xml","files":["elife-00421-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00421-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00421-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00421-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00421-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00421-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00421-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
