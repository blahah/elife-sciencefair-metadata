In the complex, Pol α and primase cooperate in the production of RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime synthesis of new DNA. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic core of yeast Pol α in unliganded form, bound to an RNA primer/DNA template and extending an RNA primer with deoxynucleotides. We combine the structural analysis with biochemical and computational data to demonstrate that Pol α specifically recognizes the A-form RNA/DNA helix and that the ensuing synthesis of B-form DNA terminates primer synthesis. The spontaneous release of the completed RNA-DNA primer by the Pol α/primase complex simplifies current models of primer transfer to leading- and lagging strand polymerases. The proposed mechanism of nucleotide polymerization by Pol α might contribute to genomic stability by limiting the amount of inaccurate DNA to be corrected at the start of each Okazaki fragment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00482"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00482"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"04","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00482","entryfile":"elife-00482-v1.xml","files":["elife-00482-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00482-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
