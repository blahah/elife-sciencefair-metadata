After release, RF-dissociation is facilitated by the G-protein RF3. Structures of ribosomal complexes with RF1 or RF2 alone or with RF3 alone—RF3 bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP-analog—have been reported. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of a post-termination ribosome containing both apo-RF3 and RF1. The conformation of RF3 is distinct from those of free RF3•GDP and ribosome-bound RF3•GDP(C/N)P. Furthermore, the conformation of RF1 differs from those observed in RF3-lacking ribosomal complexes. Our study provides structural keys to the mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange on RF3 and to an L12-mediated ribosomal recruitment of RF3. In conjunction with previous observations, our data provide the foundation to structurally characterize the complete action cycle of the G-protein RF3.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00411"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00411"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00411","entryfile":"elife-00411-v1.xml","files":["elife-00411-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00411-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
