Current models of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> circadian network consist of several coupled feedback loops composed almost exclusively of transcriptional repressors. Indeed, a central regulatory mechanism is the repression of evening-phased clock genes via the binding of morning-phased Myb-like repressors to evening element (EE) promoter motifs. We now demonstrate that a related Myb-like protein, REVEILLE8 (RVE8), is a direct transcriptional activator of EE-containing clock and output genes. Loss of RVE8 and its close homologs causes a delay and reduction in levels of evening-phased clock gene transcripts and significant lengthening of clock pace. Our data suggest a substantially revised model of the circadian oscillator, with a clock-regulated activator essential both for clock progression and control of clock outputs. Further, our work suggests that the plant clock consists of a highly interconnected, complex regulatory network rather than of coupled morning and evening feedback loops.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00473"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00473"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"04","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00473","entryfile":"elife-00473-v1.xml","files":["elife-00473-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00473-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
