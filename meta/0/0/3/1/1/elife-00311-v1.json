{"title":"Modelling dynamics in protein crystal structures by ensemble refinement","author":[{"surname":"Burnley","given-names":"B Tom"},{"surname":"Afonine","given-names":"Pavel V"},{"surname":"Adams","given-names":"Paul D"},{"surname":"Gros","given-names":"Piet"}],"abstract":"Single-structure models derived from X-ray data do not adequately account for the inherent, functionally important dynamics of protein molecules. We generated ensembles of structures by time-averaged refinement, where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying overall translation–libration–screw (TLS) model. Modeling of 20 protein datasets at 1.1–3.1 Å resolution reduced cross-validated <italic>R</italic><sub>undefined</sub> values by 0.3–4.9%, indicating that ensemble models fit the X-ray data better than single structures. The ensembles revealed that, while most proteins display a well-ordered core, some proteins exhibit a ‘molten core’ likely supporting functionally important dynamics in ligand binding, enzyme activity and protomer assembly. Order–disorder changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering specific core residues. Thus, ensemble refinement extracts dynamical details from the X-ray data that allow a more comprehensive understanding of structure–dynamics–function relationships.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00311"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00311"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"12","year":"2012"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"00311","entryfile":"elife-00311-v1.xml","files":["elife-00311-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig7-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00311-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
