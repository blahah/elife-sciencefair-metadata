We show that during the development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system, mutual inhibition among groups of neighboring postmitotic neurons during development regulates the robustness of axon target choice in a nondeterministic neuronal circuit. Specifically, neighboring postmitotic neurons communicate through Notch signaling during axonal targeting, to ensure balanced alternative axon target choices without a corresponding change in cell fate. Loss of Notch in postmitotic neurons modulates an axon's target choice. However, because neighboring axons respond by choosing the complementary target, the stereotyped connectivity pattern is preserved. In contrast, loss of Notch in clones of neighboring postmitotic neurons results in erroneous coinnervation by multiple axons. Our observations establish mutual inhibition of axonal target choice as a robustness mechanism for brain wiring and unveil a novel cell fate independent function for canonical Notch signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00337"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00337"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"03","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00337","entryfile":"elife-00337-v1.xml","files":["elife-00337-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig8-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00337-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
