{"title":"Nutrient restriction enhances the proliferative potential of cells lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN in mitotic tissues","author":[{"surname":"Nowak","given-names":"Katarzyna"},{"surname":"Seisenbacher","given-names":"Gerhard"},{"surname":"Hafen","given-names":"Ernst"},{"surname":"Stocker","given-names":"Hugo"}],"abstract":"How single cells in a mitotic tissue progressively acquire hallmarks of cancer is poorly understood. We exploited mitotic recombination in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal tissues to analyze the behavior of cells devoid of the tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, under varying nutritional conditions. Cells lacking PTEN strongly overproliferated specifically in nutrient restricted larvae. Although the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells were sensitive to starvation, they successfully competed with neighboring cells by autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms distinct from cell competition. The overgrowth was strictly dependent on the activity of the downstream components Akt/PKB and TORC1, and a reduction in amino acid uptake by reducing the levels of the amino acid transporter Slimfast caused clones of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells to collapse. Our findings demonstrate how limiting nutritional conditions impact on cells lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN to cause hyperplastic overgrowth.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00380"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00380"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00380","entryfile":"elife-00380-v1.xml","files":["elife-00380-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig7-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig7-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig7-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00380-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
