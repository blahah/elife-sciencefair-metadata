The HIV-1 Tat protein selectively recruits P-TEFb as part of a super elongation complex (SEC) organized on a flexible AFF1 or AFF4 scaffold. To understand this specificity and determine if scaffold binding alters P-TEFb conformation, we determined the structure of a tripartite complex containing the recognition regions of P-TEFb and AFF4. AFF4 meanders over the surface of the P-TEFb cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit but makes no stable contacts with the CDK9 kinase subunit. Interface mutations reduced CycT1 binding and AFF4-dependent transcription. AFF4 is positioned to make unexpected direct contacts with HIV Tat, and Tat enhances P-TEFb affinity for AFF4. These studies define the mechanism of scaffold recognition by P-TEFb and reveal an unanticipated intersubunit pocket on the AFF4 SEC that potentially represents a target for therapeutic intervention against HIV/AIDS.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00327"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00327"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"03","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00327","entryfile":"elife-00327-v1.xml","files":["elife-00327-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00327-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
