Here we find, unexpectedly, that undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) contain only six TAFs (TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11), whereas following differentiation all TAFs are expressed. Directed and global chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal an unprecedented promoter occupancy pattern: most active genes are bound by only TAFs 3 and 5 along with TBP, whereas the remaining active genes are bound by TBP and all six hESC TAFs. Consistent with these results, hESCs contain a previously undescribed complex comprising TAFs 2, 6, 7, 11 and TBP. Altering the composition of hESC TAFs, either by depleting TAFs that are present or ectopically expressing TAFs that are absent, results in misregulated expression of pluripotency genes and induction of differentiation. Thus, the selective expression and use of TAFs underlies the ability of hESCs to self-renew.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00068"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00068"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"11","year":"2012"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00068","entryfile":"elife-00068-v1.xml","files":["elife-00068-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig8-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig8-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00068-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
