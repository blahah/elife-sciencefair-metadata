Sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. Droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. In contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. Embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species. Our data suggests that this intracellular antibacterial defense system may function in adult flies, and also potentially in mice.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00003"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00003"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"11","year":"2012"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00003","entryfile":"elife-00003-v1.xml","files":["elife-00003-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00003-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
