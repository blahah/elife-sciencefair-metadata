During virus infection detection of nucleic acids is crucial for the inflammatory response. Here we identify DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a DNA sensor that activates innate immunity. We show that DNA-PK acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding cytoplasmic DNA and triggering the transcription of type I interferon (IFN), cytokine and chemokine genes in a manner dependent on IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Both cells and mice lacking DNA-PKcs show attenuated cytokine responses to both DNA and DNA viruses but not to RNA or RNA virus infection. DNA-PK has well-established functions in the DNA repair and V(D)J recombination, hence loss of DNA-PK leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, we now define a novel anti-microbial function for DNA-PK, a finding with implications for host defence, vaccine development and autoimmunity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00047"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00047"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"12","year":"2012"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00047","entryfile":"elife-00047-v1.xml","files":["elife-00047-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00047-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00047-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00047-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00047-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00047-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00047-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00047-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
