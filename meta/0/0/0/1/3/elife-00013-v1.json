{"title":"A bacterial sulfonolipid triggers multicellular development in the closest living relatives of animals","author":[{"surname":"Alegado","given-names":"Rosanna A"},{"surname":"Brown","given-names":"Laura W"},{"surname":"Cao","given-names":"Shugeng"},{"surname":"Dermenjian","given-names":"Renee K"},{"surname":"Zuzow","given-names":"Richard"},{"surname":"Fairclough","given-names":"Stephen R"},{"surname":"Clardy","given-names":"Jon"},{"surname":"King","given-names":"Nicole"}],"abstract":"Bacterially-produced small molecules exert profound influences on animal health, morphogenesis, and evolution through poorly understood mechanisms. In one of the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic>, we find that rosette colony development is induced by the prey bacterium <italic>Algoriphagus machipongonensis</italic> and its close relatives in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Here we show that a rosette inducing factor (RIF-1) produced by <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> belongs to the small class of sulfonolipids, obscure relatives of the better known sphingolipids that play important roles in signal transmission in plants, animals, and fungi. RIF-1 has extraordinary potency (femtomolar, or 10<sup>−15</sup> M) and <italic>S. rosetta</italic> can respond to it over a broad dynamic range—nine orders of magnitude. This study provides a prototypical example of bacterial sulfonolipids triggering eukaryotic morphogenesis and suggests molecular mechanisms through which bacteria may have contributed to the evolution of animals.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00013"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00013"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"10","year":"2012"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00013","entryfile":"elife-00013-v1.xml","files":["elife-00013-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00013-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
