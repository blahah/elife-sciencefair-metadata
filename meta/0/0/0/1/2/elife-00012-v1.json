Here, we show that in vivo a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocol—consisting of pairing a postsynaptic AP with visually driven presynaptic inputs—modifies a neurons' AP-response in a bidirectional way that depends on the relative AP-timing during pairing. Whereas postsynaptic APs repeatedly following presynaptic activation can convert subthreshold into suprathreshold responses, APs repeatedly preceding presynaptic activation reduce AP responses to visual stimulation. These changes were paralleled by restructuring of the neurons response to surround stimulus locations and membrane-potential time-course. Computational simulations could reproduce the observed subthreshold voltage changes only when presynaptic temporal jitter was included. Together this shows that STDP rules can modify output patterns of sensory neurons and the timing of single-APs plays a crucial role in sensory coding and plasticity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00012"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00012"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"01","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00012","entryfile":"elife-00012-v1.xml","files":["elife-00012-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00012-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
