Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are once differentiated cells that have been re-programmed to an embryonic stem cell-like state, providing a powerful platform for biology and medicine. However, they have been limited to a few mammalian species. Here we found that a set of four mammalian transcription factor genes used to generate iPSCs in mouse and humans can induce a partially reprogrammed pluripotent stem cell (PRPSCs) state in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms, in mammals, birds, fish, and fly, which span 550 million years from a common ancestor. These findings are one of the first to show cross-lineage stem cell-like induction, and to generate pluripotent-like cells for several of these species with in vivo chimeras. We suggest that the stem-cell state may be highly conserved across a wide phylogenetic range.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00036"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00036"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00036","entryfile":"elife-00036-v1.xml","files":["elife-00036-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00036-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
