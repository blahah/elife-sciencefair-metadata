FK506 treatment of dendritic cells (FKDC) limits their capacity to stimulate T cell responses. FK506 does not prevent DC survival, maturation, or costimulatory molecule expression, suggesting that the limited capacity of FKDC to stimulate T cells may be due to inhibition of calcineurin signaling in the DC. Instead, we demonstrate that DC inhibit T cells by sequestering FK506 and continuously releasing the drug over several days. T cells encountering FKDC proliferate but fail to upregulate the survival factor bcl-xl and die, and IL2 restores both bcl-xl and survival. In mice, FKDC act in an antigen-specific manner to inhibit T-cell mediated autoimmune arthritis. This establishes that DCs can act as a cellular drug delivery system to target antigen specific T cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00105"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00105"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"02","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00105","entryfile":"elife-00105-v1.xml","files":["elife-00105-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00105-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00105-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00105-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00105-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00105-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00105-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
