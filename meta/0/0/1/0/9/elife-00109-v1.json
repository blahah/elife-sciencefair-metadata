Here, we used a single vesicle–vesicle system with reconstituted SNARE and synaptotagmin-1 proteoliposomes to decipher the temporal sequence of membrane states upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection at 250–500 μM on a 100-ms timescale. Furthermore, detailed membrane morphologies were imaged with cryo-electron microscopy before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection. We discovered a heterogeneous network of immediate and delayed fusion pathways. Remarkably, all instances of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered immediate fusion started from a membrane–membrane point-contact and proceeded to complete fusion without discernible hemifusion intermediates. In contrast, pathways that involved a stable hemifusion diaphragm only resulted in fusion after many seconds, if at all. When complexin was included, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion network shifted towards the immediate pathway, effectively synchronizing fusion, especially at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration. Synaptic proteins may have evolved to select this immediate pathway out of a heterogeneous network of possible membrane fusion pathways.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00109"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00109"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"12","year":"2012"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00109","entryfile":"elife-00109-v1.xml","files":["elife-00109-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00109-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00109-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00109-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00109-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00109-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00109-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00109-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
