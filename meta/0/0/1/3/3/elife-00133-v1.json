Whereas axonal MTs are organized such that the plus-end is oriented out from the cell body, dendrites exhibit a mixed MTs polarity containing both minus-end-out and plus-end-out MTs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this differential organization, as well as its functional significance, are unknown. Here, we show that kinesin-1 is critical in establishing the characteristic minus-end-out MT organization of the dendrite in vivo. In <italic>unc-116</italic> (kinesin-1/kinesin heavy chain) mutants, the dendritic MTs adopt an axonal-like plus-end-out organization. Kinesin-1 protein is able to cross-link anti-paralleled MTs in vitro. We propose that kinesin-1 regulates the dendrite MT polarity through directly gliding the plus-end-out MTs out of the dendrite using both the motor domain and the C-terminal MT-binding domain.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00133"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00133"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"03","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00133","entryfile":"elife-00133-v1.xml","files":["elife-00133-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00133-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
