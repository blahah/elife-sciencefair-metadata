Here we present structural and functional studies of a dual RCK-containing, multi-ligand gated K<sup>+</sup> channel from <italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</italic>, named GsuK. We demonstrate that ADP and NAD<sup>+</sup> activate the GsuK channel, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as an allosteric inhibitor. Multiple crystal structures elucidate the structural basis of multi-ligand gating in GsuK, and also reveal a unique ion conduction pore with segmented inner helices. Structural comparison leads us to propose a novel pore opening mechanics that is distinct from other K<sup>+</sup> channels.
