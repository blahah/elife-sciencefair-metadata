Here, we used a phylogenetic framework to measure mRNA profiles in 15 yeast species from the phylum <italic>Ascomycota</italic> and reconstruct the evolution of their modular regulatory programs along a time course of growth on glucose over 300 million years. We found that modules have diverged proportionally to phylogenetic distance, with prominent changes in gene regulation accompanying changes in lifestyle and ploidy, especially in carbon metabolism. Paralogs have significantly contributed to regulatory divergence, typically within a very short window from their duplication. Paralogs from a whole genome duplication (WGD) event have a uniquely substantial contribution that extends over a longer span. Similar patterns occur when considering the evolution of the heat shock regulatory program measured in eight of the species, suggesting that these are general evolutionary principles.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00603"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00603"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00603","entryfile":"elife-00603-v1.xml","files":["elife-00603-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig14-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00603-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
