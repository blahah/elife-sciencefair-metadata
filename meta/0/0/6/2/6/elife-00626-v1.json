Human to mosquito transmission was assessed using 171 direct mosquito feeding assays conducted in Burkina Faso and Kenya. <italic>Plasmodium</italic><italic>falciparum</italic> infects <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> efficiently at low densities (4% mosquitoes at 1/µl blood), although substantially more (>200/µl) are required to increase infection further. In a site in Burkina Faso, children harbour more gametocytes than adults though the non-linear relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection means that (per person) they only contribute slightly more to transmission. This method can be used to determine the reservoir of infection in different endemic settings. Interventions reducing gametocyte density need to be highly effective in order to halt human–mosquito transmission, although their use can be optimised by targeting those contributing the most to transmission.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00626"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00626"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"05","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00626","entryfile":"elife-00626-v1.xml","files":["elife-00626-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00626-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
