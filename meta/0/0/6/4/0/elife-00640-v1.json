Gender-appropriate production of the sexually dimorphic transcription factors doublesex and fruitless controls sexual differentiation and sexual behavior. <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males exhibited increased maleâ€“male courtship and reduced reproductive success with females. Females showed a strong preference for wild-type males over <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males when given a choice of mates. These effects were traced to aberrant pheromone production. We identified the sex-specific splicing factor <italic>transformer</italic> as a functionally significant target of <italic>miR-124</italic> in this context, suggesting a role for <italic>miR-124</italic> in the control of male sexual differentiation and behavior, by limiting inappropriate expression of the female form of <italic>transformer</italic>. <italic>miR-124</italic> is required to ensure fidelity of gender-appropriate pheromone production in males. Use of a microRNA provides a secondary means of controlling the cascade of sex-specific splicing events that controls sexual differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00640"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00640"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00640","entryfile":"elife-00640-v1.xml","files":["elife-00640-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00640-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
