TRPM5 was required for PMA and ATP-induced secretion of MUC5AC from the post-Golgi secretory granules. Stable knockdown of TRPM5 reduced a TRPM5-like current and ATP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. ATP-induced MUC5AC secretion depended strongly on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which was markedly reduced in TRPM5 knockdown cells. The difference in ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry between control and TRPM5 knockdown cells was abrogated in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and by inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX). Accordingly, MUC5AC secretion was reduced by inhibition of NCX. Thus TRPM5 activation by ATP couples TRPM5-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> entry to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via an NCX to trigger MUC5AC secretion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00658"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00658"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"05","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00658","entryfile":"elife-00658-v1.xml","files":["elife-00658-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00658-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
