How these phosphorylations affect the structure and enzymatic function of PTEN is poorly understood. To gain insight into the mechanistic basis of PTEN regulation by phosphorylation, we generated semisynthetic site-specifically tetra-phosphorylated PTEN using expressed protein ligation. By employing a combination of biophysical and enzymatic approaches, we have found that purified tail-phosphorylated PTEN relative to its unphosphorylated counterpart shows reduced catalytic activity and membrane affinity and undergoes conformational compaction likely involving an intramolecular interaction between its C-tail and the C2 domain. Our results suggest that there is a competition between membrane phospholipids and PTEN phospho-tail for binding to the C2 domain. These findings reveal a key aspect of PTEN’s regulation and suggest pharmacologic approaches for direct PTEN activation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00691"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00691"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00691","entryfile":"elife-00691-v1.xml","files":["elife-00691-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig6-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00691-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
