However, in many cases the relationship between the two variables is more complex, and it is not valid to say that one variable is independent and the other is dependent. When analysing such data researchers should consider plotting the three regression lines that can be calculated for any two-dimensional scatter plot.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00638"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00638"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"03","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00638","entryfile":"elife-00638-v1.xml","files":["elife-00638-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00638-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
