Frh accounts for about 1% of the cytoplasmic protein and forms a huge complex consisting of FrhABG heterotrimers with each a [NiFe] center, four Fe-S clusters and an FAD. Here, we report the structure determined by near-atomic resolution cryo-EM of Frh with and without bound substrate F<sub>420</sub>. The polypeptide chains of FrhB, for which there was no homolog, was traced de novo from the EM map. The 1.2-MDa complex contains 12 copies of the heterotrimer, which unexpectedly form a spherical protein shell with a hollow core. The cryo-EM map reveals strong electron density of the chains of metal clusters running parallel to the protein shell, and the F<sub>420</sub>-binding site is located at the end of the chain near the outside of the spherical structure.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00218"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00218"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"03","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00218","entryfile":"elife-00218-v1.xml","files":["elife-00218-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00218-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
