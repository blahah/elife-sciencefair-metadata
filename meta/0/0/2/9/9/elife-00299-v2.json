We carried out an integrative, longitudinal study combining genetic, transcriptional, and immunologic data in humans given seasonal influenza vaccine. We identified 20 genes exhibiting a transcriptional response to vaccination, significant genotype effects on gene expression, and correlation between the transcriptional and antibody responses. The results show that variation at the level of genes involved in membrane trafficking and antigen processing significantly influences the human response to influenza vaccination. More broadly, we demonstrate that an integrative study design is an efficient alternative to existing methods for the identification of genes involved in complex traits.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00299"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00299"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"00299","entryfile":"elife-00299-v2.xml","files":["elife-00299-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00299-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-00299-v1.xml"]}
