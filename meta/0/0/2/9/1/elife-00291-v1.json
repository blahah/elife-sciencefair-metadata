The mechanisms by which UNC93B1 mediates these regulatory effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that UNC93B1 enters the secretory pathway and directly controls the packaging of TLRs into COPII vesicles that bud from the ER. Unlike other COPII loading factors, UNC93B1 remains associated with the TLRs through post-Golgi sorting steps. Unexpectedly, these steps are different among endosomal TLRs. TLR9 requires UNC93B1-mediated recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) for delivery to endolysosomes while TLR7, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 utilize alternative trafficking pathways. Thus, our study describes a mechanism for differential sorting of endosomal TLRs by UNC93B1, which may explain the distinct roles played by these receptors in certain autoimmune diseases.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00291"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00291"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"02","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00291","entryfile":"elife-00291-v1.xml","files":["elife-00291-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00291-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
