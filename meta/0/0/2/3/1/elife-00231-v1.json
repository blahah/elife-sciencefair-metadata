An understanding of this network will benefit from systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> that have the ability to genetically manipulate neural activities. However, the fly's small size makes it challenging to analyze walking in this system. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed an optical method coupled with high-speed imaging that allows the tracking and quantification of gait parameters in freely walking flies with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using this method, we present a comprehensive description of many locomotion parameters, such as gait, tarsal positioning, and intersegmental and left-right coordination for wild type fruit flies. Surprisingly, we find that inactivation of sensory neurons in the fly's legs, to block proprioceptive feedback, led to deficient step precision, but interleg coordination and the ability to execute a tripod gait were unaffected.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00231"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00231"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"01","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00231","entryfile":"elife-00231-v1.xml","files":["elife-00231-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00231-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
