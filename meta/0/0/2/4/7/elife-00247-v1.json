{"title":"Tissue absence initiates regeneration through Follistatin-mediated inhibition of Activin signaling","author":[{"surname":"Gavi√±o","given-names":"Michael A"},{"surname":"Wenemoser","given-names":"Danielle"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Irving E"},{"surname":"Reddien","given-names":"Peter W"}],"abstract":"Regeneration is widespread, but mechanisms that activate regeneration remain mysterious. Planarians are capable of whole-body regeneration and mount distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence and those that do not. A major question is how these distinct responses are activated. We describe a follistatin homolog (<italic>Smed-follistatin</italic>) required for planarian regeneration. <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> inhibition blocks responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs (<italic>Smed-activin-1</italic> and <italic>Smed-activin-2</italic>) are required for the <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> phenotype. Finally, <italic>Smed-follistatin</italic> is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. These data suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence and identify a mechanism critical for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00247"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00247"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00247","entryfile":"elife-00247-v1.xml","files":["elife-00247-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00247-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
