While RESOLFT has been shown to discern nanostructures in living cells, the reversibly photoswitchable green fluorescent protein (rsEGFP) employed in these experiments was switched rather slowly and recording lasted tens of minutes. We now report on the generation of rsEGFP2 providing faster switching and the use of this protein to demonstrate 25â€“250 times faster recordings.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00248"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00248"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"12","year":"2012"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00248","entryfile":"elife-00248-v1.xml","files":["elife-00248-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00248-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
