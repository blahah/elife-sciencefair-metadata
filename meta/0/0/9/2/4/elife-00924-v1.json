We showed previously that adult forebrain stem cell function declines during aging because of increased expression of <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs, evolutionarily conserved heterochronic genes that reduce HMGA2 expression. Here we asked whether <italic>let-7</italic> targets also regulate changes between fetal and adult stem cells. We found a second <italic>let-7</italic> target, the RNA binding protein IMP1, that is expressed by fetal, but not adult, neural stem cells. IMP1 expression was promoted by Wnt signaling and Lin28a expression and opposed by <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs. <italic>Imp1</italic>-deficient neural stem cells were prematurely depleted in the dorsal telencephalon due to accelerated differentiation, impairing pallial expansion. IMP1 post-transcriptionally inhibited the expression of differentiation-associated genes while promoting the expression of self-renewal genes, including <italic>Hmga2</italic>. A network of heterochronic gene products including Lin28a, <italic>let-7</italic>, IMP1, and HMGA2 thus regulates temporal changes in stem cell properties.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00924"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00924"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00924","entryfile":"elife-00924-v1.xml","files":["elife-00924-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00924-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
