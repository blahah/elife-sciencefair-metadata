Muscle fibers are particularly susceptible to injury, and defective sarcolemma resealing causes muscular dystrophy. Caveolae accumulate in dystrophic muscle fibers and caveolin and cavin mutations cause muscle pathology, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that muscle fibers and other cell types repair membrane wounds by a mechanism involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis of lysosomes, release of acid sphingomyelinase, and rapid lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis. Wounding or exposure to sphingomyelinase triggered endocytosis and intracellular accumulation of caveolar vesicles, which gradually merged into larger compartments. The pore-forming toxin SLO was directly visualized entering cells within caveolar vesicles, and depletion of caveolin inhibited plasma membrane resealing. Our findings directly link lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis to the maintenance of plasma membrane and muscle fiber integrity, providing a mechanistic explanation for the muscle pathology associated with mutations in caveolae proteins.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00926"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00926"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00926","entryfile":"elife-00926-v1.xml","files":["elife-00926-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig12-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00926-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
