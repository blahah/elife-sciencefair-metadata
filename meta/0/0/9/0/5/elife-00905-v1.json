Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and Akt signaling. Loss of cavin-3 increases Akt signaling at the expense of ERK, while gain of cavin-3 increases ERK signaling at the expense Akt. Cavin-3 facilitates signal transduction to ERK by anchoring caveolae to the membrane skeleton of the plasma membrane via myosin-1c. Caveolae are lipid raft specializations that contain an ERK activation module and loss of the cavin-3 linkage reduces the abundance of caveolae, thereby separating this ERK activation module from signaling receptors. Loss of cavin-3 promotes Akt signaling through suppression of EGR1 and PTEN. The in vitro consequences of the loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), accelerated cell proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. The in vivo consequences of cavin-3 knockout are increased lactate production and cachexia.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00905"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00905"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00905","entryfile":"elife-00905-v1.xml","files":["elife-00905-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00905-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
