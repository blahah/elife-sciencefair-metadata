The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and its natural pathogen, the positive-strand RNA virus Orsay, have recently emerged as a new animal model of host-virus interaction. Using a genome-wide association study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild populations and quantitative trait locus mapping, we identify a 159 base-pair deletion in the conserved <italic>drh-1</italic> gene (encoding a RIG-I-like helicase) as a major determinant of viral sensitivity. We show that DRH-1 is required for the initiation of an antiviral RNAi pathway and the generation of virus-derived siRNAs (viRNAs). In mammals, RIG-I-domain containing proteins trigger an interferon-based innate immunity pathway in response to RNA virus infection. Our work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> demonstrates that the RIG-I domain has an ancient role in viral recognition. We propose that RIG-I acts as modular viral recognition factor that couples viral recognition to different effector pathways including RNAi and interferon responses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00994"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00994"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"10","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00994","entryfile":"elife-00994-v1.xml","files":["elife-00994-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00994-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
