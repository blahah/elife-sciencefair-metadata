Under this assumption, recent single-molecule studies proposed a branched Brownian ratchet mechanism that necessitates a putative secondary nucleotide binding site on the enzyme. By challenging individual yeast RNA polymerase II with a nucleosomal barrier, we separately measured the forward and reverse translocation rates. Surprisingly, we found that the forward translocation rate is comparable to the catalysis rate. This finding reveals a linear, non-branched ratchet mechanism for the nucleotide addition cycle in which translocation is one of the rate-limiting steps. We further determined all the major on- and off-pathway kinetic parameters in the elongation cycle. The resulting translocation energy landscape shows that the off-pathway states are favored thermodynamically but not kinetically over the on-pathway states, conferring the enzyme its propensity to pause and furnishing the physical basis for transcriptional regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00971"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00971"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"00971","entryfile":"elife-00971-v1.xml","files":["elife-00971-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00971-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
