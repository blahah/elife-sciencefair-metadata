Approximately 22% of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) during therapy. The prevailing explanation for this is drug-induced paradoxical ERK activation, resulting in hyperproliferation. Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib/PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), principally ZAK. JNK signaling is suppressed in multiple contexts, including in cSCC of vemurafenib-treated patients, as well as in mice. Expression of a mutant ZAK that cannot be inhibited reverses the suppression of JNK activation and apoptosis. Our results implicate suppression of JNK-dependent apoptosis as a significant, independent mechanism that cooperates with paradoxical ERK activation to induce cSCC, suggesting broad implications for understanding toxicities associated with BRAF inhibitors and for their use in combination therapies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00969"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00969"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00969","entryfile":"elife-00969-v1.xml","files":["elife-00969-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00969-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
