A few genes are transcribed before this stage but how this differential activation is accomplished is still an open question. We have performed ChIP-seq experiments on tightly staged <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and show that massive recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with widespread pausing occurs de novo during the midblastula transition. However, âˆ¼100 genes are strongly occupied by Pol II before this timepoint and most of them do not show Pol II pausing, consistent with a requirement for rapid transcription during the fast nuclear cycles. This global change in Pol II pausing correlates with distinct core promoter elements and associates a TATA-enriched promoter with the rapid early transcription. This suggests that promoters are differentially used during the zygotic genome activation, presumably because they have distinct dynamic properties.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00861"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00861"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"08","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00861","entryfile":"elife-00861-v1.xml","files":["elife-00861-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00861-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
