Whether distant relatives of the vertebrate TMEM16 families also form CaCCs is an intriguing open question. Here we report that a TMEM16 family member from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Subdued (CG16718), is a CaCC. Amino acid substitutions of Subdued alter the ion selectivity and kinetic properties of the CaCC channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293T cells. This <italic>Drosophila</italic> channel displays characteristics of classic CaCCs, thereby providing evidence for evolutionarily conserved biophysical properties in the TMEM16 family. Additionally, we show that knockout flies lacking <italic>subdued</italic> gene activity more readily succumb to death caused by ingesting the pathogenic bacteria <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, suggesting that <italic>subdued</italic> has novel functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> host defense.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00862"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00862"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00862","entryfile":"elife-00862-v1.xml","files":["elife-00862-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00862-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
