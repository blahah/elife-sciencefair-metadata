{"title":"ATP-dependent chromatin assembly is functionally distinct from chromatin remodeling","author":[{"surname":"Torigoe","given-names":"Sharon E"},{"surname":"Patel","given-names":"Ashok"},{"surname":"Khuong","given-names":"Mai T"},{"surname":"Bowman","given-names":"Gregory D"},{"surname":"Kadonaga","given-names":"James T"}],"abstract":"Chromatin assembly involves the combined action of ATP-dependent motor proteins and histone chaperones. Because motor proteins in chromatin assembly also function as chromatin remodeling factors, we investigated the relationship between ATP-driven chromatin assembly and chromatin remodeling in the generation of periodic nucleosome arrays. We found that chromatin remodeling-defective Chd1 motor proteins are able to catalyze ATP-dependent chromatin assembly. The resulting nucleosomes are not, however, spaced in periodic arrays. Wild-type Chd1, but not chromatin remodeling-defective Chd1, can catalyze the conversion of randomly-distributed nucleosomes into periodic arrays. These results reveal a functional distinction between ATP-dependent nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling, and suggest a model for chromatin assembly in which randomly-distributed nucleosomes are formed by the nucleosome assembly function of Chd1, and then regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays are generated by the chromatin remodeling activity of Chd1. These findings uncover an unforeseen level of specificity in the role of motor proteins in chromatin assembly.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00863"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00863"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"08","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00863","entryfile":"elife-00863-v1.xml","files":["elife-00863-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00863-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00863-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00863-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00863-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00863-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00863-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00863-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
