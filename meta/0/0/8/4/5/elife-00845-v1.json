Here we show that at physiological temperature endocytosis kinetics at hippocampal and cortical nerve terminals show a bi-phasic dependence on electrical activity. Endocytosis accelerates for the first 15â€“25 APs during bursts of action potential firing, after which it slows with increasing burst length creating an optimum stimulus for this kinetic parameter. We show that activity-dependent acceleration is only prominent at physiological temperature and that the mechanism of this modulation is based on the dephosphorylation of dynamin 1. Nerve terminals in which dynamin 1 and 3 have been replaced with dynamin 1 harboring dephospho- or phospho-mimetic mutations in the proline-rich domain eliminate the acceleration phase by either setting endocytosis at an accelerated state or a decelerated state, respectively.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00845"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00845"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00845","entryfile":"elife-00845-v1.xml","files":["elife-00845-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00845-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00845-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00845-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00845-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00845-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00845-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
