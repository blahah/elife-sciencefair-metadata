In the <italic>Eμ-myc</italic> Burkitt’s lymphoma model, <italic>mir-17-92</italic> exhibits potent oncogenic activity by repressing c-Myc-induced apoptosis, primarily through its <italic>miR-19</italic> components. Surprisingly, <italic>mir-17-92</italic> also encodes the <italic>miR-92</italic> component that negatively regulates its oncogenic cooperation with c-Myc. This <italic>miR-92</italic> effect is, at least in part, mediated by its direct repression of Fbw7, which promotes the proteosomal degradation of c-Myc. Thus, overexpressing <italic>miR-92</italic> leads to aberrant c-Myc increase, imposing a strong coupling between excessive proliferation and p53-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, <italic>miR-92</italic> antagonizes the oncogenic <italic>miR-19</italic> miRNAs; and such functional interaction coordinates proliferation and apoptosis during c-Myc-induced oncogenesis. This <italic>miR-19:miR-92</italic> antagonism is disrupted in B-lymphoma cells that favor a greater increase of <italic>miR-19</italic> over <italic>miR-92</italic>. Altogether, we suggest a new paradigm whereby the unique gene structure of a polycistronic oncomir confers an intricate balance between oncogene and tumor suppressor crosstalk.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00822"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00822"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"10","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00822","entryfile":"elife-00822-v1.xml","files":["elife-00822-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00822-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
