CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. In this study, we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In mitotic cells, membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be ‘restarted’ in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00829"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00829"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00829","entryfile":"elife-00829-v1.xml","files":["elife-00829-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00829-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
