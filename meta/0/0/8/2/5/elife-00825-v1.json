Here we show that <italic>MYBL2</italic>, a gene within the 20q CDR, is expressed at sharply reduced levels in CD34+ cells from most MDS cases (65%; n = 26), whether or not they harbor 20q abnormalities. In a murine competitive reconstitution model, <italic>Mybl2</italic> knockdown by RNAi to 20–30% of normal levels in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors resulted in clonal dominance of these ‘sub-haploinsufficient’ cells, which was reflected in all blood cell lineages. By 6 months post-transplantation, the reconstituted mice had developed a clonal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder originating from the cells with aberrantly reduced <italic>Mybl2</italic> expression. We conclude that downregulation of <italic>MYBL2</italic> activity below levels predicted by classical haploinsufficiency underlies the clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in a large fraction of human myeloid malignancies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00825"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00825"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00825","entryfile":"elife-00825-v1.xml","files":["elife-00825-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00825-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
