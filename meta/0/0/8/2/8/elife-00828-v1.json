HECT E3s use a two-step mechanism to ligate ubiquitin to target proteins. The first step is guided by interactions between the catalytic HECT domain and the E2∼ubiquitin intermediate, which promote formation of a transient, thioester-bonded HECT∼ubiquitin intermediate. Here we report that the second step of ligation is mediated by a distinct catalytic architecture established by both the HECT E3 and its covalently linked ubiquitin. The structure of a chemically trapped proxy for an E3∼ubiquitin-substrate intermediate reveals three-way interactions between ubiquitin and the bilobal HECT domain orienting the E3∼ubiquitin thioester bond for ligation, and restricting the location of the substrate-binding domain to prioritize target lysines for ubiquitination. The data allow visualization of an E2-to-E3-to-substrate ubiquitin transfer cascade, and show how HECT-specific ubiquitin interactions driving multiple reactions are repurposed by a major E3 conformational change to promote ligation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00828"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00828"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"08","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00828","entryfile":"elife-00828-v1.xml","files":["elife-00828-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig16-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig17-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00828-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
