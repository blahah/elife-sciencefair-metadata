{"title":"Mechanism of synergistic activation of Arp2/3 complex by cortactin and N-WASP","author":[{"surname":"Helgeson","given-names":"Luke A"},{"surname":"Nolen","given-names":"Brad J"}],"abstract":"Nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) initiate branched actin network assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex, a branched actin filament nucleator. Cellular actin networks contain multiple NPFs, but how they coordinately regulate Arp2/3 complex is unclear. Cortactin is an NPF that activates Arp2/3 complex weakly on its own, but with WASP/N-WASP, another class of NPFs, potently activates. We dissect the mechanism of synergy and propose a model in which cortactin displaces N-WASP from nascent branches as a prerequisite for nucleation. Single-molecule imaging revealed that unlike WASP/N-WASP, cortactin remains bound to junctions during nucleation, and specifically targets junctions with a âˆ¼160-fold increased on rate over filament sides. N-WASP must be dimerized for potent synergy, and targeted mutations indicate release of dimeric N-WASP from nascent branches limits nucleation. Mathematical modeling shows cortactin-mediated displacement but not N-WASP recycling or filament recruitment models can explain synergy. Our results provide a molecular basis for coordinate Arp2/3 complex regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00884"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00884"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00884","entryfile":"elife-00884-v1.xml","files":["elife-00884-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00884-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
