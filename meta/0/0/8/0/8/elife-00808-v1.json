{"title":"Condensin controls recruitment of RNA polymerase II to achieve nematode X-chromosome dosage compensation","author":[{"surname":"Kruesi","given-names":"William S"},{"surname":"Core","given-names":"Leighton J"},{"surname":"Waters","given-names":"Colin T"},{"surname":"Lis","given-names":"John T"},{"surname":"Meyer","given-names":"Barbara J"}],"abstract":"The X-chromosome gene regulatory process called dosage compensation ensures that males (1X) and females (2X) express equal levels of X-chromosome transcripts. The mechanism in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been elusive due to improperly annotated transcription start sites (TSSs). Here we define TSSs and the distribution of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide in wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective animals to dissect this regulatory mechanism. Our TSS-mapping strategy integrates GRO-seq, which tracks nascent transcription, with a new derivative of this method, called GRO-cap, which recovers nascent RNAs with 5′ caps prior to their removal by co-transcriptional processing. Our analyses reveal that promoter-proximal pausing is rare, unlike in other metazoans, and promoters are unexpectedly far upstream from the 5′ ends of mature mRNAs. We find that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> equalizes X-chromosome expression between the sexes, to a level equivalent to autosomes, by reducing Pol II recruitment to promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes using a chromosome-restructuring condensin complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00808"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00808"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00808","entryfile":"elife-00808-v1.xml","files":["elife-00808-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig7-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00808-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
