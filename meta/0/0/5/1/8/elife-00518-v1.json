DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin (PP2B phosphatase) also limits the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but the mechanism through which it does so is unknown. Herein, we show that TAX-6•CNB-1 and UNC-43, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Calcineurin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) orthologs, respectively, also regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Moreover, UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, thus promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00518"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00518"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00518","entryfile":"elife-00518-v1.xml","files":["elife-00518-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig9-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig9-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00518-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
