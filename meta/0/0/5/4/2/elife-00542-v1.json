{"title":"The insulin receptor cellular IRES confers resistance to eIF4A inhibition","author":[{"surname":"Olson","given-names":"Calla M"},{"surname":"Donovan","given-names":"Marissa R"},{"surname":"Spellberg","given-names":"Michael J"},{"surname":"Marr","given-names":"Michael T"}],"abstract":"Under conditions of stress, such as limited growth factor signaling, translation is inhibited by the action of 4E-BP and PDCD4. These proteins, through inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A, respectively, impair cap-dependent translation. Under stress conditions FOXO transcription factors activate 4E-BP expression amplifying the repression. Here we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> FOXO binds the PDCD4 promoter and stimulates the transcription of PDCD4 in response to stress. We have shown previously that the 5′ UTR of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like receptor (dINR) supports cap-independent translation that is resistant to 4E-BP. Using hippuristanol, an eIF4A inhibitor, we find that translation of dINR UTR containing transcripts are also resistant to eIF4A inhibition. In addition, the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor 5′ UTRs support cap-independent translation and have a similar resistance to hippuristanol. This resistance to inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A indicates a conserved strategy to allow translation of growth factor receptors under stress conditions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00542"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00542"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00542","entryfile":"elife-00542-v1.xml","files":["elife-00542-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00542-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00542-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00542-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00542-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
