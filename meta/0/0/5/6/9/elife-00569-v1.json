As urochordates are considered to be the closest living invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, they are ideal subjects for whole genome sequence analyses. Using a novel method for high-throughput sequencing of eukaryotic genomes, we sequenced and assembled 580 Mbp of the <italic>B. schlosseri</italic> genome. The genome assembly is comprised of nearly 14,000 intron-containing predicted genes, and 13,500 intron-less predicted genes, 40% of which could be confidently parceled into 13 (of 16 haploid) chromosomes. A comparison of homologous genes between <italic>B. schlosseri</italic> and other diverse taxonomic groups revealed genomic events underlying the evolution of vertebrates and lymphoid-mediated immunity. The <italic>B. schlosseri</italic> genome is a community resource for studying alternative modes of reproduction, natural transplantation reactions, and stem cell-mediated regeneration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00569"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00569"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"07","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00569","entryfile":"elife-00569-v1.xml","files":["elife-00569-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00569-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
