Mechanisms that direct neural differentiation of PSCs involve growth factor signaling and transcription regulation. However, it is unknown whether and how electrical activity influences this process. Here we report a high throughput imaging-based screen, which uncovers that selamectin, an anti-helminthic therapeutic compound with reported activity on invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels, promotes neural differentiation of PSCs. We show that selamectin’s pro-neurogenic activity is mediated by γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in subsets of neural rosette progenitors, accompanied by increased proneural and lineage-specific transcription factor expression and cell cycle exit. In vivo, selamectin promotes neurogenesis in developing zebrafish. Our results establish a chemical screening platform that reveals activity-dependent neural differentiation from PSCs. Compounds identified in this and future screening might prove therapeutically beneficial for treating neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00508"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00508"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00508","entryfile":"elife-00508-v1.xml","files":["elife-00508-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00508-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
