{"title":"Stapled Golgi cisternae remain in place as cargo passes through the stack","author":[{"surname":"Lavieu","given-names":"Gregory"},{"surname":"Zheng","given-names":"Hong"},{"surname":"Rothman","given-names":"James E"}],"abstract":"We have designed a membrane ‘staple’, which consists of membrane-anchored repeats of the trans-aggregating FM domain that face the lumen of the secretory pathway. In the presence of the disaggregating drug these proteins transit the secretory pathway. When the drug is removed these proteins form electron-dense plaques which we term staples. Unexpectedly, when initially positioned within the cis-Golgi, staples remained at the cis face of the Golgi even after many hours. By contrast, soluble FM-aggregates transited the Golgi. Staples and soluble aggregates placed in cis-Golgi cisternae therefore have different fates. Whereas the membrane staples are located in the flattened, stacked central regions of the cisternae, the soluble aggregates are in the dilated rims. This suggests that while the cisternae are static on the time scale of protein traffic, the dilated rims are mobile and progress in the cis → trans direction via a mechanism that we term ‘Rim Progression’.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"00558"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.00558"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"06","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"00558","entryfile":"elife-00558-v1.xml","files":["elife-00558-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-00558-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
