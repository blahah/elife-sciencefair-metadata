{"title":"Structure of the SAS-6 cartwheel hub from <italic>Leishmania major</italic>","author":[{"surname":"van Breugel","given-names":"Mark"},{"surname":"Wilcken","given-names":"Rainer"},{"surname":"McLaughlin","given-names":"Stephen H"},{"surname":"Rutherford","given-names":"Trevor J"},{"surname":"Johnson","given-names":"Christopher M"}],"abstract":"Centrioles are cylindrical cell organelles with a ninefold symmetric peripheral microtubule array that is essential to template cilia and flagella. They are built around a central cartwheel assembly that is organized through homo-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS-6, but whether SAS-6 self-assembly can dictate cartwheel and thereby centriole symmetry is unclear. Here we show that <italic>Leishmania major</italic> SAS-6 crystallizes as a 9-fold symmetric cartwheel and provide the X-ray structure of this assembly at a resolution of 3.5 Ã…. We furthermore demonstrate that oligomerization of <italic>Leishmania</italic> SAS-6 can be inhibited by a small molecule in vitro and provide indications for its binding site. Our results firmly establish that SAS-6 can impose cartwheel symmetry on its own and indicate how this process might occur mechanistically in vivo. Importantly, our data also provide a proof-of-principle that inhibition of SAS-6 oligomerization by small molecules is feasible.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01812"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01812"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01812","entryfile":"elife-01812-v1.xml","files":["elife-01812-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01812-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
