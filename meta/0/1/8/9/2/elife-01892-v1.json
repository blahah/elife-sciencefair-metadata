{"title":"RNA structures that resist degradation by Xrn1 produce a pathogenic Dengue virus RNA","author":[{"surname":"Chapman","given-names":"Erich G"},{"surname":"Moon","given-names":"Stephanie L"},{"surname":"Wilusz","given-names":"Jeffrey"},{"surname":"Kieft","given-names":"Jeffrey S"}],"abstract":"Dengue virus is a growing global health threat. Dengue and other flaviviruses commandeer the host cell’s RNA degradation machinery to generate the small flaviviral RNA (sfRNA), a noncoding RNA that induces cytopathicity and pathogenesis. Host cell exonuclease Xrn1 likely loads on the 5′ end of viral genomic RNA and degrades processively through ∼10 kB of RNA, halting near the 3′ end of the viral RNA. The surviving RNA is the sfRNA. We interrogated the architecture of the complete Dengue 2 sfRNA, identifying five independently-folded RNA structures, two of which quantitatively confer Xrn1 resistance. We developed an assay for real-time monitoring of Xrn1 resistance that we used with mutagenesis and RNA folding experiments to show that Xrn1-resistant RNAs adopt a specific fold organized around a three-way junction. Disrupting the junction’s fold eliminates the buildup of disease-related sfRNAs in human cells infected with a flavivirus, directly linking RNA structure to sfRNA production.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01892"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01892"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01892","entryfile":"elife-01892-v1.xml","files":["elife-01892-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01892-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
