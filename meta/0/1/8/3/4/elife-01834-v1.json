Ensemble measurements and electrophysiological sieving experiments show that the open-diameter of the channel pore is >25 Å, but the exact size and whether the conformational change follows a helix-tilt or barrel-stave model are unclear. Here we report measurements of the distance changes on liposome-reconstituted MscL transmembrane α-helices, using a ‘virtual sorting’ single-molecule fluorescence energy transfer. We observed directly that the channel opens via the helix-tilt model and the open pore reaches 2.8 nm in diameter. In addition, based on the measurements, we developed a molecular dynamics model of the channel structure in the open state which confirms our direct observations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01834"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01834"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01834","entryfile":"elife-01834-v1.xml","files":["elife-01834-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01834-resp-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
