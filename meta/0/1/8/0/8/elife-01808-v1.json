Many CAPs act at the plasma membrane of cells leading to membrane destabilization and permeabilization. In this study, we describe a novel cell lysis mechanism for fungal and tumor cells by the plant defensin NaD1 that acts via direct binding to the plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). We determined the crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> complex, revealing a striking oligomeric arrangement comprising seven dimers of NaD1 that cooperatively bind the anionic headgroups of 14 PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules through a unique ‘cationic grip’ configuration. Site-directed mutagenesis of NaD1 confirms that PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated oligomerization is important for fungal and tumor cell permeabilization. These observations identify an innate recognition system by NaD1 for direct binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> that permeabilizes cells via a novel membrane disrupting mechanism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01808"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01808"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01808","entryfile":"elife-01808-v1.xml","files":["elife-01808-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01808-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
