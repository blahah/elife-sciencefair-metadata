A major challenge of lineage conversion is to generate specific cell subtypes. The pancreatic islets contain three major hormone-secreting endocrine subtypes: insulin<sup>+</sup> β-cells, glucagon<sup>+</sup> α-cells, and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> δ-cells. We previously reported that a combination of three transcription factors, Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1, directly reprograms pancreatic acinar cells to β-cells. We now show that acinar cells can be converted to δ-like and α-like cells by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. Thus, three major islet endocrine subtypes can be derived by acinar reprogramming. Ngn3 promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells, and also promotes δ-specification in the absence of other factors. δ-specification is in turn suppressed by Mafa and Pdx1 during α- and β-cell induction. These studies identify a set of defined factors whose combinatorial actions reprogram acinar cells to distinct islet endocrine subtypes in vivo.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01846"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01846"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01846","entryfile":"elife-01846-v1.xml","files":["elife-01846-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01846-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
