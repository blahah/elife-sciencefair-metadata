Predominant sources of spontaneous DSBs remain elusive. We report synthetic technology for quantifying DSBs using fluorescent-protein fusions of double-strand DNA end-binding protein, Gam of bacteriophage Mu. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> GamGFP forms foci at chromosomal DSBs and pinpoints their subgenomic locations. Spontaneous DSBs occur mostly one per cell, and correspond with generations, supporting replicative models for spontaneous breakage, and providing the first true breakage rates. In mammalian cells GamGFPâ€”labels laser-induced DSBs antagonized by end-binding protein Ku; co-localizes incompletely with DSB marker 53BP1 suggesting superior DSB-specificity; blocks resection; and demonstrates DNA breakage via APOBEC3A cytosine deaminase. We demonstrate directly that some spontaneous DSBs occur outside of S phase. The data illuminate spontaneous DNA breakage in <italic>E. coli</italic> and human cells and illustrate the versatility of fluorescent-Gam for interrogation of DSBs in living cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01222"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01222"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"10","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01222","entryfile":"elife-01222-v1.xml","files":["elife-01222-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01222-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
