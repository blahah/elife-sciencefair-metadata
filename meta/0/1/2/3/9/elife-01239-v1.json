{"title":"A diversity of localized timescales in network activity","author":[{"surname":"Chaudhuri","given-names":"Rishidev"},{"surname":"Bernacchia","given-names":"Alberto"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Xiao-Jing"}],"abstract":"Neurons show diverse timescales, so that different parts of a network respond with disparate temporal dynamics. Such diversity is observed both when comparing timescales across brain areas and among cells within local populations; the underlying circuit mechanism remains unknown. We examine conditions under which spatially local connectivity can produce such diverse temporal behavior.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01239"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01239"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01239","entryfile":"elife-01239-v1.xml","files":["elife-01239-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01239-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01239-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01239-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01239-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01239-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01239-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01239-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
