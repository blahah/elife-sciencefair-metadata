Depletion of PTBP2 in developing mouse cortex leads to degeneration of these tissues over the first three postnatal weeks, a time when the normal cortex expands and develops mature circuits. Cultured <italic>Ptbp2</italic><sup>undefined</sup> neurons exhibit the same initial viability as wild type, with proper neurite outgrowth and marker expression. However, these mutant cells subsequently fail to mature and die after a week in culture. Transcriptome-wide analyses identify many exons that share a pattern of mis-regulation in the mutant brains, where isoforms normally found in adults are precociously expressed in the developing embryo. These transcripts encode proteins affecting neurite growth, pre- and post-synaptic assembly, and synaptic transmission. Our results define a new genetic regulatory program, where PTBP2 acts to temporarily repress expression of adult protein isoforms until the final maturation of the neuron.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01201"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01201"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01201","entryfile":"elife-01201-v1.xml","files":["elife-01201-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01201-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
