Its diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) provides a naturally occurring phage-display system, but engineering efforts are hampered without atomic structures. Here, we report a cryo electron microscopy structure of the BPP-1 head at 3.5 Å resolution. Our atomic model shows two of the three protein folds representing major viral lineages: jellyroll for its cement protein (CP) and HK97-like (‘Johnson’) for its major capsid protein (MCP). Strikingly, the fold topology of MCP is permuted non-circularly from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. We illustrate that the new topology is likely the only feasible alternative of the old topology. β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01299"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01299"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01299","entryfile":"elife-01299-v1.xml","files":["elife-01299-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01299-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
