However, the cellular and genetic changes that ultimately led to the evolution of multicellularity are not known. In this study, we describe an aggregative multicellular stage in the protist <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic>, a close unicellular relative of metazoans. Remarkably, transition to the aggregative stage is associated with significant upregulation of orthologs of genes known to establish multicellularity and tissue architecture in metazoans. We further observe transitions in regulated alternative splicing during the <italic>C. owczarzaki</italic> life cycle, including the deployment of an exon network associated with signaling, a feature of splicing regulation so far only observed in metazoans. Our results reveal the existence of a highly regulated aggregative stage in <italic>C. owczarzaki</italic> and further suggest that features of aggregative behavior in an ancestral protist may had been co-opted to develop some multicellular properties currently seen in metazoans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01287"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01287"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01287","entryfile":"elife-01287-v1.xml","files":["elife-01287-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig11-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01287-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
