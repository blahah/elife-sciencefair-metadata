Many Kv channels undergo a progressive loss of ion conductance in the presence of a prolonged voltage stimulus, termed slow inactivation, but the atomic determinants that regulate the kinetics of this process remain obscure. Using a combination of synthetic amino acid analogs and concatenated channel subunits we establish two H-bonds near the extracellular surface of the channel that endow Kv channels with a mechanism to time the entry into slow inactivation: an intra-subunit H-bond between Asp447 and Trp434 and an inter-subunit H-bond connecting Tyr445 to Thr439. Breaking of either interaction triggers slow inactivation by means of a local disruption in the selectivity filter, while severing the Tyr445â€“Thr439 H-bond is likely to communicate this conformational change to the adjacent subunit(s).","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01289"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01289"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01289","entryfile":"elife-01289-v1.xml","files":["elife-01289-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01289-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
