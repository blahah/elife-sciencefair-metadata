Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. In this study, we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in âˆ¼20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01256"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01256"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01256","entryfile":"elife-01256-v1.xml","files":["elife-01256-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01256-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
