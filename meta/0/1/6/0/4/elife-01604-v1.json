{"title":"Earlier menarche is associated with a higher prevalence of Herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) in young women in rural Malawi","author":[{"surname":"Glynn","given-names":"Judith R"},{"surname":"Kayuni","given-names":"Ndoliwe"},{"surname":"Gondwe","given-names":"Levie"},{"surname":"Price","given-names":"Alison J"},{"surname":"Crampin","given-names":"Amelia C"}],"abstract":"Remarkably little is known about associations between age at menarche and sexually transmitted infections, although girls with earlier menarche tend to have earlier sexual debut and school drop-out, so an association might be expected. In a population-based survey of >3000 women aged 15–30 in northern Malawi we show that those with earlier menarche had earlier sexual debut, earlier marriage and were more often Herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) positive. Compared to those with menarche aged <14, the age-adjusted odds ratios for HSV-2 were 0.89 (95%CI 0.71–1.1), 0.71 (0.57–0.89) and 0.69 (0.54–0.89) for menarche aged 14, 15 and 16+ respectively. This association persisted after adjusting for socio-economic factors, including schooling, and for sexual behaviour. No such association was seen with HIV infection, which is much less common and less uniformly distributed than HSV-2 in this population. The extra vulnerability of girls with earlier menarche needs to be recognised.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01604"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01604"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01604","entryfile":"elife-01604-v1.xml","files":["elife-01604-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01604-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01604-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
