The Arf1/COPI protein machinery, known for its role in vesicle trafficking, regulates LD morphology, targeting of specific proteins to LDs and lipolysis through unclear mechanisms. Recent evidence shows that Arf1/COPI can bud nano-LDs (∼60 nm diameter) from phospholipid-covered oil/water interfaces in vitro. We show that Arf1/COPI proteins localize to cellular LDs, are sufficient to bud nano-LDs from cellular LDs, and are required for targeting specific TG-synthesis enzymes to LD surfaces. Cells lacking Arf1/COPI function have increased amounts of phospholipids on LDs, resulting in decreased LD surface tension and impairment to form bridges to the ER. Our findings uncover a function for Arf1/COPI proteins at LDs and suggest a model in which Arf1/COPI machinery acts to control ER-LD connections for localization of key enzymes of TG storage and catabolism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01607"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01607"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01607","entryfile":"elife-01607-v1.xml","files":["elife-01607-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01607-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
