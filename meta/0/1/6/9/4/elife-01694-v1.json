We report a stress resolution pathway initiated by the nuclear receptor LRH-1 that is independent of known unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Like mice lacking primary UPR components, hepatic <italic>Lrh-1</italic>-null mice cannot resolve ER stress, despite a functional UPR. In response to ER stress, LRH-1 induces expression of the kinase <italic>Plk3</italic>, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor ATF2. <italic>Plk3</italic>-null mice also cannot resolve ER stress, and restoring <italic>Plk3</italic> expression in <italic>Lrh-1</italic>-null cells rescues ER stress resolution. Reduced or heightened ATF2 activity also sensitizes or desensitizes cells to ER stress, respectively. LRH-1 agonist treatment increases ER stress resistance and decreases cell death. We conclude that LRH-1 initiates a novel pathway of ER stress resolution that is independent of the UPR, yet equivalently required. Targeting LRH-1 may be beneficial in human disorders associated with chronic ER stress.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01694"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01694"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01694","entryfile":"elife-01694-v1.xml","files":["elife-01694-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01694-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
