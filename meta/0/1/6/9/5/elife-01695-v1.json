{"title":"Greatwall-phosphorylated Endosulfine is both an inhibitor and a substrate of PP2A-B55 heterotrimers","author":[{"surname":"Williams","given-names":"Byron C"},{"surname":"Filter","given-names":"Joshua J"},{"surname":"Blake-Hodek","given-names":"Kristina A"},{"surname":"Wadzinski","given-names":"Brian E"},{"surname":"Fuda","given-names":"Nicholas J"},{"surname":"Shalloway","given-names":"David"},{"surname":"Goldberg","given-names":"Michael L"}],"abstract":"During M phase, Endosulfine (Endos) family proteins are phosphorylated by Greatwall kinase (Gwl), and the resultant pEndos inhibits the phosphatase PP2A-B55, which would otherwise prematurely reverse many CDK-driven phosphorylations. We show here that PP2A-B55 is the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. The kinetic parameters for PP2A-B55’s action on pEndos are orders of magnitude lower than those for CDK-phosphorylated substrates, suggesting a simple model for PP2A-B55 regulation that we call inhibition by unfair competition. As the name suggests, during M phase PP2A-B55’s attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much more avidly and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl is inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance changes: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the phosphatase can refocus its attention on CDK-phosphorylated substrates. This mechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate pEndos, and how pEndos controls PP2A-B55.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01695"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01695"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01695","entryfile":"elife-01695-v1.xml","files":["elife-01695-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01695-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
