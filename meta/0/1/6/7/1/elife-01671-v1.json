We present FCS and STED experiments showing that dense membrane bound actin networks have severe influence on lipid phase separation. A minimal actin cortex was bound to a supported lipid bilayer via biotinylated lipid streptavidin complexes (pinning sites). In general, actin binding to ternary membranes prevented macroscopic liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domain formation, even at low temperature. Instead, depending on the type of pinning lipid, an actin correlated multi-domain pattern was observed. FCS measurements revealed hindered diffusion of lipids in the presence of an actin network. To explain our experimental findings, a new simulation model is proposed, in which the membrane composition, the membrane curvature, and the actin pinning sites are all coupled. Our results reveal a mechanism how cells may prevent macroscopic demixing of their membrane components, while at the same time regulate the local membrane composition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01671"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01671"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01671","entryfile":"elife-01671-v1.xml","files":["elife-01671-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01671-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
