Most studies of mouse NK cells, however, have focused on conventional NK (cNK) cells in the spleen. Recently, we described two populations of liver NK cells, tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells and those resembling splenic cNK cells. However, their lineage relationship was unclear; trNK cells could be developing cNK cells, related to thymic NK cells, or a lineage distinct from both cNK and thymic NK cells. Herein we used detailed transcriptomic, flow cytometric, and functional analysis and transcription factor-deficient mice to determine that liver trNK cells form a distinct lineage from cNK and thymic NK cells. Taken together with analysis of trNK cells in other tissues, there are at least four distinct lineages of NK cells: cNK, thymic, liver (and skin) trNK, and uterine trNK cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01659"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01659"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"01659","entryfile":"elife-01659-v1.xml","files":["elife-01659-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01659-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
