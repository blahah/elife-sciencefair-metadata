Despite conservation of active-site residues, the Ras-related Rab GTPase activation pathway differs from Ras and between different Rabs. Analysis of DENND1-Rab35, Rabex-Rab5, TRAPP-Rab1 and DrrA-Rab1 suggests Rabs have the potential for activation by distinct GDP-release pathways. Conserved active-site residues in the Rab switch II region stabilising the nucleotide-free form differentiate these pathways. For DENND1-Rab35 and DrrA-Rab1 the Rab active-site glutamine, often mutated to create constitutively active forms, is involved in GEF mediated GDP-release. By contrast, in Rab5 the switch II aspartate is required for Rabex mediated GDP-release. Furthermore, Rab1 switch II glutamine mutants refractory to activation by DrrA can be activated by TRAPP, showing that a single Rab can be activated by more than one mechanistically distinct GDP-release pathway. These findings highlight plasticity in the activation mechanisms of closely related Rab GTPases.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01623"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01623"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01623","entryfile":"elife-01623-v1.xml","files":["elife-01623-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01623-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01623-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01623-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01623-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01623-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
