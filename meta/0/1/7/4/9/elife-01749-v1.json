To investigate the functional relevance of lncRNAs in various physiological conditions, we have developed a collection of 18 lncRNA knockout strains in which the locus is maintained transcriptionally active. Initial characterization revealed peri- and postnatal lethal phenotypes in three mutant strains (<italic>Fendrr</italic>, <italic>Peril</italic>, and <italic>Mdgt</italic>), the latter two exhibiting incomplete penetrance and growth defects in survivors. We also report growth defects for two additional mutant strains (<italic>linc–Brn1b</italic> and <italic>linc–Pint</italic>). Further analysis revealed defects in lung, gastrointestinal tract, and heart in <italic>Fendrr</italic><sup>undefined</sup> neonates, whereas <italic>linc–Brn1b</italic><sup>undefined</sup> mutants displayed distinct abnormalities in the generation of upper layer II–IV neurons in the neocortex. This study demonstrates that lncRNAs play critical roles in vivo and provides a framework and impetus for future larger-scale functional investigation into the roles of lncRNA molecules.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01749"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01749"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01749","entryfile":"elife-01749-v1.xml","files":["elife-01749-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01749-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
