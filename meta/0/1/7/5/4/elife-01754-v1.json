{"title":"How HIV-1 Nef hijacks the AP-2 clathrin adaptor to downregulate CD4","author":[{"surname":"Ren","given-names":"Xuefeng"},{"surname":"Park","given-names":"Sang Yoon"},{"surname":"Bonifacino","given-names":"Juan S"},{"surname":"Hurley","given-names":"James H"}],"abstract":"The Nef protein of HIV-1 downregulates the cell surface co-receptor CD4 by hijacking the clathrin adaptor complex AP-2. The structural basis for the hijacking of AP-2 by Nef is revealed by a 2.9 Å crystal structure of Nef bound to the α and σ2 subunits of AP-2. Nef binds to AP-2 via its central loop (residues 149–179) and its core. The determinants for Nef binding include residues that directly contact AP-2 and others that stabilize the binding-competent conformation of the central loop. Residues involved in both direct and indirect interactions are required for the binding of Nef to AP-2 and for downregulation of CD4. These results lead to a model for the docking of the full AP-2 tetramer to membranes as bound to Nef, such that the cytosolic tail of CD4 is situated to interact with its binding site on Nef.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01754"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01754"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"01754","entryfile":"elife-01754-v1.xml","files":["elife-01754-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01754-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
