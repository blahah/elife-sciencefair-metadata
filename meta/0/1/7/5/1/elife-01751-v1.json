The structure of many insect pheromones typically consists of a hydrocarbon backbone, occasionally modified with various functional oxygen groups. Here we show that sex-specific triacylclyerides (TAGs) are broadly conserved across the subgenus <italic>Drosophila</italic> in 11 species and represent a novel class of pheromones that has been largely overlooked. In desert-adapted drosophilids, 13 different TAGs are secreted exclusively by males from the ejaculatory bulb, transferred to females during mating, and function synergistically to inhibit courtship from other males. Sex-specific TAGs are comprised of at least one short branched tiglic acid and a long linear fatty acyl component, an unusual structural motif that has not been reported before in other natural products. The diversification of chemical cues used by desert-adapted <italic>Drosophila</italic> as pheromones may be related to their specialized diet of fermenting cacti.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01751"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01751"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01751","entryfile":"elife-01751-v1.xml","files":["elife-01751-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig5-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01751-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
