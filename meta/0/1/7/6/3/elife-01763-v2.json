In this study, we report the identification of MELK as a novel oncogenic kinase from an in vivo tumorigenesis screen using a kinome-wide open reading frames (ORFs) library. Analysis of clinical data reveals a high level of MELK overexpression in BBC, a feature that is largely dependent on FoxM1, a master mitotic transcription factor that is also found to be highly overexpressed in BBC. Ablation of MELK selectively impairs proliferation of basal-like, but not luminal breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, depletion of MELK in BBC cells induces caspase-dependent cell death, preceded by defective mitosis. Finally, we find that Melk is not required for mouse development and physiology. Together, these data indicate that MELK is a normally non-essential kinase, but is critical for BBC and thus represents a promising selective therapeutic target for the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01763"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01763"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01763","entryfile":"elife-01763-v2.xml","files":["elife-01763-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01763-v1.xml"]}
