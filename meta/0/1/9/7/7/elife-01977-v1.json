We previously reported that miR-142 and miR-150 are upregulated in human breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) as compared to the non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that miR-142 efficiently recruits the <italic>APC</italic> mRNA to an RNA-induced silencing complex, activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in an APC-suppression dependent manner, and activates the expression of miR-150. Enforced expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in normal mouse mammary stem cells resulted in the regeneration of hyperproliferative mammary glands in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous miR-142 effectively suppressed organoid formation by BCSCs and slowed tumor growth initiated by human BCSCs in vivo. These results suggest that in some tumors, miR-142 regulates the properties of BCSCs at least in part by activating the WNT signaling pathway and miR-150 expression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01977"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01977"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"01977","entryfile":"elife-01977-v1.xml","files":["elife-01977-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01977-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
