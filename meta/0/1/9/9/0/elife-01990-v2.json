It is generally unknown how complex bacterial structures such as PGNs are perceived by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and whether host hydrolytic activities facilitate decomposition of bacterial matrices and generation of soluble PRR ligands. Here we show that <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, upon bacterial infection or exposure to microbial patterns, produces a metazoan lysozyme-like hydrolase (lysozyme 1, LYS1). LYS1 activity releases soluble PGN fragments from insoluble bacterial cell walls and cleavage products are able to trigger responses typically associated with plant immunity. Importantly, <italic>LYS1</italic> mutant genotypes exhibit super-susceptibility to bacterial infections similar to that observed on PGN receptor mutants. We propose that plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of complex bacterial structures, and that soluble pattern generation might aid PRR-mediated immune activation in cell layers adjacent to infection sites.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01990"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01990"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"01990","entryfile":"elife-01990-v2.xml","files":["elife-01990-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01990-v1.xml"]}
