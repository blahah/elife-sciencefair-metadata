{"title":"Structural basis of GSK-3 inhibition by N-terminal phosphorylation and by the Wnt receptor LRP6","author":[{"surname":"Stamos","given-names":"Jennifer L"},{"surname":"Chu","given-names":"Matthew Ling-Hon"},{"surname":"Enos","given-names":"Michael D"},{"surname":"Shah","given-names":"Niket"},{"surname":"Weis","given-names":"William I"}],"abstract":"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a key regulator of many cellular signaling pathways. Unlike most kinases, GSK-3 is controlled by inhibition rather than by specific activation. In the insulin and several other signaling pathways, phosphorylation of a serine present in a conserved sequence near the amino terminus of GSK-3 generates an auto-inhibitory peptide. In contrast, Wnt/Î²-catenin signal transduction requires phosphorylation of Ser/Pro rich sequences present in the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6, and these motifs inhibit GSK-3 activity. We present crystal structures of GSK-3 bound to its phosphorylated N-terminus and to two of the phosphorylated LRP6 motifs. A conserved loop unique to GSK-3 undergoes a dramatic conformational change that clamps the bound pseudo-substrate peptides, and reveals the mechanism of primed substrate recognition. The structures rationalize target sequence preferences and suggest avenues for the design of inhibitors selective for a subset of pathways regulated by GSK-3.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01998"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01998"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01998","entryfile":"elife-01998-v1.xml","files":["elife-01998-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01998-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01998-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01998-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01998-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01998-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01998-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
