{"title":"A conserved MCM single-stranded DNA binding element is essential for replication initiation","author":[{"surname":"Froelich","given-names":"Clifford A"},{"surname":"Kang","given-names":"Sukhyun"},{"surname":"Epling","given-names":"Leslie B"},{"surname":"Bell","given-names":"Stephen P"},{"surname":"Enemark","given-names":"Eric J"}],"abstract":"The ring-shaped MCM helicase is essential to all phases of DNA replication. The complex loads at replication origins as an inactive double-hexamer encircling duplex DNA. Helicase activation converts this species to two active single hexamers that encircle single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The molecular details of MCM DNA interactions during these events are unknown. We determined the crystal structure of the <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> MCM N-terminal domain hexamer bound to ssDNA and define a conserved MCM-ssDNA binding motif (MSSB). Intriguingly, ssDNA binds the MCM ring interior perpendicular to the central channel with defined polarity. In eukaryotes, the MSSB is conserved in several Mcm2-7 subunits, and MSSB mutant combinations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mcm2-7 are not viable. Mutant Mcm2-7 complexes assemble and are recruited to replication origins, but are defective in helicase loading and activation. Our findings identify an important MCM-ssDNA interaction and suggest it functions during helicase activation to select the strand for translocation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01993"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01993"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01993","entryfile":"elife-01993-v1.xml","files":["elife-01993-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01993-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
