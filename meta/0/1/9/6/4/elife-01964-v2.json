To address the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of miR-142, we utilized a novel reporter and a loss-of-function mouse allele that we have recently generated. In this study, we show that miR-142 is broadly expressed in the adult hematopoietic system. Our data further reveal that miR-142 is critical for megakaryopoiesis. Genetic ablation of miR-142 caused impaired megakaryocyte maturation, inhibition of polyploidization, abnormal proplatelet formation, and thrombocytopenia. Finally, we characterized a network of miR-142-3p targets which collectively control actin filament homeostasis, thereby ensuring proper execution of actin-dependent proplatelet formation. Our study reveals a pivotal role for miR-142 activity in megakaryocyte maturation and function, and demonstrates a critical contribution of a single miRNA in orchestrating cytoskeletal dynamics and normal hemostasis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01964"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01964"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01964","entryfile":"elife-01964-v2.xml","files":["elife-01964-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01964-v1.xml"]}
