In this study, we demonstrate that T cell-specific deletion of the IL-6 receptor α chain (IL-6Rα) results in impaired Th1 and Th17 T cell responses in vivo, and a defect in Tfh function. Depletion of Tregs in these mice rescued the Th1 but not the Th17 response. Our data suggest that IL-6 signaling in effector T cells is required to overcome Treg-mediated suppression in vivo. We show that IL-6 cooperates with IL-1β to block the suppressive effect of Tregs on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, at least in part by controlling their responsiveness to IL-2. In addition, although IL-6Rα-deficient T cells mount normal primary Th1 responses in the absence of Tregs, they fail to mature into functional memory cells, demonstrating a key role for IL-6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01949"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01949"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"05","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01949","entryfile":"elife-01949-v2.xml","files":["elife-01949-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-01949-v1.xml"]}
