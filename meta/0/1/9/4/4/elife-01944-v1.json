Such coordination of individual cell responses within multicellular populations is critical for accurate collective reactions to shared environmental cues. However, cytokine production may saturate as a function of antigen input, or be dominated by the precursor frequency of antigen-specific T cells. Surprisingly, we found that T cells scale their collective output of IL-2 to total antigen input over a large dynamic range, independently of population size. Through experimental quantitation and computational modeling, we demonstrate that this scaling is enforced by an inhibitory cross-talk between antigen and IL-2 signaling, and a nonlinear acceleration of IL-2 secretion per cell. Our study reveals how time-integration of these regulatory loops within individual cell signaling generates scaled collective responses and can be leveraged for immune monitoring.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01944"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01944"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"04","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01944","entryfile":"elife-01944-v1.xml","files":["elife-01944-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01944-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
