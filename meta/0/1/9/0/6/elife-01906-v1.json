Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling Brahma (Brm) complex functions cooperatively with another chromatin remodeling factor, Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to suppress the formation of ectopic type II neuroblasts. We show that multiple components of the Brm complex and HDAC3 physically associate with Earmuff (Erm), a type II-specific transcription factor that prevents dedifferentiation of INPs into neuroblasts. Consistently, the predicted Erm-binding motif is present in most of known binding loci of Brm. Furthermore, <italic>brm</italic> and <italic>hdac3</italic> genetically interact with <italic>erm</italic> to prevent type II neuroblast overgrowth. Thus, the Brm-HDAC3-Erm repressor complex suppresses dedifferentiation of INPs back into type II neuroblasts.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01906"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01906"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01906","entryfile":"elife-01906-v1.xml","files":["elife-01906-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01906-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
