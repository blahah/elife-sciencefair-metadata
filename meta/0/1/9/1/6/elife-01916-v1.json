Although the network underlying this process has been studied extensively, we do not yet have an end-to-end understanding of chemotaxis. Specifically, how the rotational states of a cell’s flagella cooperatively determine whether the cell ‘runs’ or ‘tumbles’ remains poorly characterized. Here, we measure the swimming behavior of individual <italic>E. coli</italic> cells while simultaneously detecting the rotational states of each flagellum. We find that a simple mathematical expression relates the cell’s run/tumble bias to the number and average rotational state of its flagella. However, due to inter-flagellar correlations, an ‘effective number’ of flagella—smaller than the actual number—enters into this relation. Data from a chemotaxis mutant and stochastic modeling suggest that fluctuations of the regulator CheY-P are the source of flagellar correlations. A consequence of inter-flagellar correlations is that run/tumble behavior is only weakly dependent on number of flagella.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01916"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01916"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01916","entryfile":"elife-01916-v1.xml","files":["elife-01916-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01916-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
