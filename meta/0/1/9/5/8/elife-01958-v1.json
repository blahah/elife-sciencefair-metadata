Identifying new suppressors of the pathway is important for finding new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we show that <italic>MUL1</italic> suppresses <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The suppression is achieved through the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Mitofusin, which itself causes <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> mutant-like toxicity when overexpressed. We further show that removing <italic>MUL1</italic> in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> loss-of-function mutant aggravates phenotypes caused by loss of either gene alone, leading to lethality in flies and degeneration in mouse cortical neurons. Together, these observations show that <italic>MUL1</italic> acts in parallel to the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway on a shared target <italic>mitofusin</italic> to maintain mitochondrial integrity. The <italic>MUL1</italic> pathway compensates for loss of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals and is a promising therapeutic target for PD.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01958"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01958"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"06","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"01958","entryfile":"elife-01958-v1.xml","files":["elife-01958-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01958-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
