Mutations in <italic>rab7</italic> are thought to cause the dominant neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) by a gain-of-function mechanism. Here we show that loss of <italic>rab7</italic>, but not overexpression of <italic>rab7</italic> CMT2B mutants, causes adult-onset neurodegeneration in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. All CMT2B mutant proteins retain 10–50% function based on quantitative imaging, electrophysiology, and rescue experiments in sensory and motor neurons in vivo. Consequently, expression of CMT2B mutants at levels between 0.5 and 10-fold their endogenous levels fully rescues the neuropathy-like phenotypes of the <italic>rab7</italic> mutant. Live imaging reveals that CMT2B proteins are inefficiently recruited to endosomes, but do not impair endosomal maturation. These findings are not consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. Instead, they indicate a dosage-dependent sensitivity of neurons to <italic>rab7</italic>-dependent degradation. Our results suggest a therapeutic approach opposite to the currently proposed reduction of mutant protein function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01064"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01064"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01064","entryfile":"elife-01064-v1.xml","files":["elife-01064-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01064-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
