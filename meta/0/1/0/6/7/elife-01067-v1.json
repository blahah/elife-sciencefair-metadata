It has recently been proposed that such heterogeneity exists during normal embryonic development to allow position independent patterning based on ‘salt and pepper’ differentiation and sorting out. However, the molecular basis of lineage priming and how it leads to reproducible cell type proportioning are poorly understood. To address this, we employed a novel forward genetic approach in the model organism <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. These studies reveal that the Ras-GTPase regulator <italic>gefE</italic> is required for normal lineage priming and salt and pepper differentiation. This is because Ras-GTPase activity sets the intrinsic response threshold to lineage specific differentiation signals. Importantly, we show that although <italic>gefE</italic> expression is uniform, transcription of its target, <italic>rasD</italic>, is both heterogeneous and dynamic, thus providing a novel mechanism for heterogeneity generation and position-independent differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01067"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01067"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01067","entryfile":"elife-01067-v1.xml","files":["elife-01067-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01067-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
