{"title":"Apoptotic cells can induce non-autonomous apoptosis through the TNF pathway","author":[{"surname":"Pérez-Garijo","given-names":"Ainhoa"},{"surname":"Fuchs","given-names":"Yaron"},{"surname":"Steller","given-names":"Hermann"}],"abstract":"Apoptotic cells can produce signals to instruct cells in their local environment, including ones that stimulate engulfment and proliferation. We identified a novel mode of communication by which apoptotic cells induce additional apoptosis in the same tissue. Strong induction of apoptosis in one compartment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc causes apoptosis of cells in the other compartment, indicating that dying cells can release long-range death factors. We identified Eiger, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog, as the signal responsible for apoptosis-induced apoptosis (AiA). Eiger is produced in apoptotic cells and, through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, is able to propagate the initial apoptotic stimulus. We also show that during coordinated cell death of hair follicle cells in mice, TNF-α is expressed in apoptotic cells and is required for normal cell death. AiA provides a mechanism to explain cohort behavior of dying cells that is seen both in normal development and under pathological conditions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01004"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01004"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01004","entryfile":"elife-01004-v1.xml","files":["elife-01004-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01004-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
