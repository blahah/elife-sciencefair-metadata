This process generates highly branched arrays of filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate network growth without restraining it.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01008"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01008"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"09","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01008","entryfile":"elife-01008-v1.xml","files":["elife-01008-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01008-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
