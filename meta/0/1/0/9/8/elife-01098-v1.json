GHRH knockout mice are remarkably long-lived, exhibiting major shifts in the expression of genes related to xenobiotic detoxification, stress resistance, and insulin signaling. These mutant mice also have increased adiponectin levels and alterations in glucose homeostasis consistent with the removal of the counter-insulin effects of growth hormone. While these effects overlap with those of caloric restriction, we show that the effects of caloric restriction (CR) and the GHRH mutation are additive, with lifespan of GHRH-KO mutants further increased by CR. We conclude that GHRH-KO mice feature perturbations in a network of signaling pathways related to stress resistance, metabolic control and inflammation, and therefore provide a new model that can be used to explore links between GHRH repression, downregulation of the somatotropic axis, and extended longevity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01098"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01098"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"10","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01098","entryfile":"elife-01098-v1.xml","files":["elife-01098-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01098-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
