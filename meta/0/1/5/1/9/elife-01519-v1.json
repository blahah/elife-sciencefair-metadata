In this study, we present the mechanistic basis of a configuration-specific enzyme that selectively removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of dimeric D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog shows how it uses an invariant ‘cross-subunit’ Gly-<italic>cis</italic>Pro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. While no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, the unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition provides a clear explanation for DTD’s ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The strict chiral specificity elegantly explains how the enriched cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. The study thus provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01519"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01519"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01519","entryfile":"elife-01519-v1.xml","files":["elife-01519-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01519-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
