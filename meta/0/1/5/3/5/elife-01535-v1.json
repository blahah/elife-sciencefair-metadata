The nature of the RNAs that trigger MDA5 activation in infected cells remains unclear. Here, we purify and characterise LGP2/RNA complexes from cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus detected by MDA5 and LGP2 but not RIG-I. We show that those complexes contain RNA that is highly enriched for MDA5-stimulatory activity and for a specific sequence corresponding to the L region of the EMCV antisense RNA. Synthesis of this sequence by in vitro transcription is sufficient to generate an MDA5 stimulatory RNA. Conversely, genomic deletion of the L region in EMCV generates viruses that are less potent at stimulating MDA5-dependent IFN production. Thus, the L region antisense RNA of EMCV is a key determinant of innate immunity to the virus and represents an RNA that activates MDA5 in virally-infected cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01535"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01535"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01535","entryfile":"elife-01535-v1.xml","files":["elife-01535-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01535-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
