Using a biosensor to visualize p53 action, we find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 is selectively active in gonadal stem cells after exposure to stressors that destabilize the genome. Similar p53 activity occurred in hyperplastic growths that were triggered either by the Ras<sup>V12</sup> oncoprotein or by failed differentiation programs. In a model of transient sterility, p53 was required for the recovery of fertility after stress, and entry into the cell cycle was delayed in p53<sup>-</sup> stem cells. Together, these observations establish that the stem cell compartment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline is selectively licensed for stress-induced activation of the p53 regulatory network. Furthermore, the findings uncover ancestral links between p53 and aberrant proliferation that are independent of DNA breaks and predate evolution of the ARF/Mdm2 axis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01530"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01530"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01530","entryfile":"elife-01530-v1.xml","files":["elife-01530-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01530-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
