However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are mostly unclear. To help address this issue, we focused on a putative IFT protein TTC26/DYF13. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches we show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. Knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, produced short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in <italic>dyf13</italic> mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicated a particular set of proteins involved in motility was specifically depleted in the <italic>dyf13</italic> mutant. These results support the concept that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01566"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01566"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01566","entryfile":"elife-01566-v1.xml","files":["elife-01566-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01566-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
