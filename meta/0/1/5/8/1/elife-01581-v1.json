{"title":"Endogenous RNA interference is driven by copy number","author":[{"surname":"Cruz","given-names":"Cristina"},{"surname":"Houseley","given-names":"Jonathan"}],"abstract":"A plethora of non-protein coding RNAs are produced throughout eukaryotic genomes, many of which are transcribed antisense to protein-coding genes and could potentially instigate RNA interference (RNAi) responses. Here we have used a synthetic RNAi system to show that gene copy number is a key factor controlling RNAi for transcripts from endogenous loci, since transcripts from multi-copy loci form double stranded RNA more efficiently than transcripts from equivalently expressed single-copy loci. Selectivity towards transcripts from high-copy DNA is therefore an emergent property of a minimal RNAi system. The ability of RNAi to selectively degrade transcripts from high-copy loci would allow suppression of newly emerging transposable elements, but such a surveillance system requires transcription. We show that low-level genome-wide pervasive transcription is sufficient to instigate RNAi, and propose that pervasive transcription is part of a defense mechanism capable of directing a sequence-independent RNAi response against transposable elements amplifying within the genome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01581"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01581"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01581","entryfile":"elife-01581-v1.xml","files":["elife-01581-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01581-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
