Active enhancers are further marked by H3K27ac. However, the methyltransferases responsible for H3K4me1/2 on enhancers remain elusive. Furthermore, how these enzymes function on enhancers to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression is unclear. In this study, we identify MLL4 (KMT2D) as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with partial functional redundancy with MLL3 (KMT2C). Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, we show that MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding and is predominantly localized on enhancers. MLL4 co-localizes with lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) on active enhancers during differentiation. Deletion of <italic>Mll4</italic> markedly decreases H3K4me1/2, H3K27ac, Mediator and Polymerase II levels on enhancers and leads to severe defects in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation. Together, these findings identify MLL4 as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase essential for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01503"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01503"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"01503","entryfile":"elife-01503-v1.xml","files":["elife-01503-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01503-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
