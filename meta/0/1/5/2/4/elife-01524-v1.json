Here, we resolved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent synaptic vesicle (SV) replenishment pathways, and found that syt 7 plays a selective and critical role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway. Mutations that disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to syt 7 abolish this function, suggesting that syt 7 functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for replenishment. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) has also been implicated in SV replenishment, and we found that loss of syt 7 was phenocopied by a CaM antagonist. Moreover, we discovered that syt 7 binds to CaM in a highly specific and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner; this interaction requires intact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites within syt 7. Together, these data indicate that a complex of two conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins, syt 7 and CaM, serve as a key regulator of SV replenishment in presynaptic nerve terminals.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01524"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01524"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01524","entryfile":"elife-01524-v1.xml","files":["elife-01524-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01524-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
