{"title":"Tapered whiskers are required for active tactile sensation","author":[{"surname":"Hires","given-names":"Samuel Andrew"},{"surname":"Pammer","given-names":"Lorenz"},{"surname":"Svoboda","given-names":"Karel"},{"surname":"Golomb","given-names":"David"}],"abstract":"Many mammals forage and burrow in dark constrained spaces. Touch through facial whiskers is important during these activities, but the close quarters makes whisker deployment challenging. The diverse shapes of facial whiskers reflect distinct ecological niches. Rodent whiskers are conical, often with a remarkably linear taper. Here we use theoretical and experimental methods to analyze interactions of mouse whiskers with objects. When pushed into objects, conical whiskers suddenly slip at a critical angle. In contrast, cylindrical whiskers do not slip for biologically plausible movements. Conical whiskers sweep across objects and textures in characteristic sequences of brief sticks and slips, which provide information about the tactile world. In contrast, cylindrical whiskers stick and remain stuck, even when sweeping across fine textures. Thus the conical whisker structure is adaptive for sensor mobility in constrained environments and in feature extraction during active haptic exploration of objects and surfaces.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01350"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01350"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01350","entryfile":"elife-01350-v1.xml","files":["elife-01350-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01350-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01350-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01350-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01350-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01350-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01350-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
