{"title":"microRNA-1 regulates sarcomere formation and suppresses smooth muscle gene expression in the mammalian heart","author":[{"surname":"Heidersbach","given-names":"Amy"},{"surname":"Saxby","given-names":"Chris"},{"surname":"Carver-Moore","given-names":"Karen"},{"surname":"Huang","given-names":"Yu"},{"surname":"Ang","given-names":"Yen-Sin"},{"surname":"de Jong","given-names":"Pieter J"},{"surname":"Ivey","given-names":"Kathryn N"},{"surname":"Srivastava","given-names":"Deepak"}],"abstract":"<italic>microRNA-1 (miR-1)</italic> is an evolutionarily conserved, striated muscle-enriched miRNA. Most mammalian genomes contain two copies of miR-1, and in mice, deletion of a single locus, <italic>miR-1-2</italic>, causes incompletely penetrant lethality and subtle cardiac defects. Here, we report that deletion of <italic>miR-1-1</italic> resulted in a phenotype similar to that of the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> mutant. Compound <italic>miR-1</italic> knockout mice died uniformly before weaning due to severe cardiac dysfunction. <italic>miR-1</italic>-null cardiomyocytes had abnormal sarcomere organization and decreased phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain-2 (MLC2), a critical cytoskeletal regulator. The smooth muscle-restricted inhibitor of MLC2 phosphorylation, Telokin, was ectopically expressed in the myocardium, along with other smooth muscle genes. <italic>miR-1</italic> repressed Telokin expression through direct targeting and by repressing its transcriptional regulator, Myocardin. Our results reveal that <italic>miR-1</italic> is required for postnatal cardiac function and reinforces the striated muscle phenotype by regulating both transcriptional and effector nodes of the smooth muscle gene expression network.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01323"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01323"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01323","entryfile":"elife-01323-v1.xml","files":["elife-01323-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01323-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
