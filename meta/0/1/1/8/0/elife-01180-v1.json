{"title":"Position of UNC-13 in the active zone regulates synaptic vesicle release probability and release kinetics","author":[{"surname":"Zhou","given-names":"Keming"},{"surname":"Stawicki","given-names":"Tamara M"},{"surname":"Goncharov","given-names":"Alexandr"},{"surname":"Jin","given-names":"Yishi"}],"abstract":"The presynaptic active zone proteins UNC-13/Munc13s are essential for synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis by directly interacting with SV fusion apparatus. An open question is how their association with active zones, hence their position to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites, regulates SV release. The N-termini of major UNC-13/Munc13 isoforms contain a non-calcium binding C<sub>2</sub>A domain that mediates protein homo- or hetero-meric interactions. Here, we show that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> UNC-13 regulates release probability of evoked release and its precise active zone localization. Kinetics analysis of SV release supports that the proximity of UNC-13 to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites, mediated by the C<sub>2</sub>A-domain containing N-terminus, is critical for accelerating neurotransmitter release. Additionally, the C<sub>2</sub>A domain is specifically required for spontaneous release. These data reveal multiple roles of UNC-13 C<sub>2</sub>A domain, and suggest that spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may involve a common pool of SVs at the active zone.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01180"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01180"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01180","entryfile":"elife-01180-v1.xml","files":["elife-01180-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01180-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
