Here, we used sub-diffraction resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to resolve the in situ molecular organization of proteins within the kidney glomerular basement membrane (GBM), an essential mediator of glomerular ultrafiltration. Using multichannel STORM and STORM-electron microscopy correlation, we constructed a molecular reference frame that revealed a laminar organization of ECM proteins within the GBM. Separate analyses of domains near the N- and C-termini of agrin, laminin, and collagen IV in mouse and human GBM revealed a highly oriented macromolecular organization. Our analysis also revealed disruptions in this GBM architecture in a mouse model of Alport syndrome. These results provide the first nanoscopic glimpse into the organization of a complex ECM.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01149"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01149"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"10","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01149","entryfile":"elife-01149-v1.xml","files":["elife-01149-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01149-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
