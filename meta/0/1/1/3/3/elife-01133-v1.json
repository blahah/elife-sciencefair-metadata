How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear. We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in addition to protecting cohesin, plays an important role in turning off the SAC, in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2â€™s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, as is its ability to silence the SAC, with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01133"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01133"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01133","entryfile":"elife-01133-v1.xml","files":["elife-01133-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01133-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
