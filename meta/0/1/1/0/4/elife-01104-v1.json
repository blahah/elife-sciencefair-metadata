For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess the postmortem interval (PMI), but errors can range from days to months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids many of these limitations. Here we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days. Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01104"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01104"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"10","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01104","entryfile":"elife-01104-v1.xml","files":["elife-01104-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01104-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01104-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01104-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01104-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01104-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
