Using paired human and viral data from 1071 individuals, we ran >3000 genome-wide scans, testing for associations between host DNA polymorphisms, HIV-1 sequence variation and plasma viral load (VL), while considering human and viral population structure. We observed significant human SNP associations to a total of 48 HIV-1 amino acid variants (p<2.4 × 10<sup>−12</sup>). All associated SNPs mapped to the HLA class I region. Clinical relevance of host and pathogen variation was assessed using VL results. We identified two critical advantages to the use of viral variation for identifying host factors: (1) association signals are much stronger for HIV-1 sequence variants than VL, reflecting the ‘intermediate phenotype’ nature of viral variation; (2) association testing can be run without any clinical data. The proposed genome-to-genome approach highlights sites of genomic conflict and is a strategy generally applicable to studies of host–pathogen interaction.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01123"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01123"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"10","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01123","entryfile":"elife-01123-v1.xml","files":["elife-01123-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01123-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01123-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
