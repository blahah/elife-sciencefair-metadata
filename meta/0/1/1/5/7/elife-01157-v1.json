In three diverse patients with known zolpidem responses we identify a distinctive pattern of EEG dynamics that suggests a mechanistic model. In the absence of zolpidem, all subjects show a strong low frequency oscillatory peak ∼6–10 Hz in the EEG power spectrum most prominent over frontocentral regions and with high coherence (∼0.7–0.8) within and between hemispheres. Zolpidem administration sharply reduces EEG power and coherence at these low frequencies. The ∼6–10 Hz activity is proposed to arise from intrinsic membrane properties of pyramidal neurons that are passively entrained across the cortex by locally-generated spontaneous activity. Activation by zolpidem is proposed to arise from a combination of initial direct drug effects on cortical, striatal, and thalamic populations and further activation of underactive brain regions induced by restoration of cognitively-mediated behaviors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01157"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01157"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"11","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01157","entryfile":"elife-01157-v1.xml","files":["elife-01157-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01157-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
