In mouse sperm, the principal K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>KSper</sub>) is carried by the Slo3 channel, which sets the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) in a strongly pH<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner. Here, we show that I<sub>KSper</sub> in human sperm is activated weakly by pH<sub>i</sub> and more strongly by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Correspondingly, V<sub>m</sub> is strongly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and less so by pH<sub>i</sub>. We find that inhibitors of Slo3 suppress human I<sub>KSper</sub>, and we identify the Slo3 protein in the flagellum of human sperm. Moreover, heterologously expressed human Slo3, but not mouse Slo3, is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> rather than by alkaline pH<sub>i</sub>; current–voltage relations of human Slo3 and human I<sub>KSper</sub> are similar. We conclude that Slo3 represents the principal K<sup>+</sup> channel in human sperm that carries the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated I<sub>KSper</sub> current. We propose that, in human sperm, the progesterone-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx carried by voltage-gated CatSper channels is limited by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-controlled hyperpolarization via Slo3.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01438"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01438"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"03","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01438","entryfile":"elife-01438-v1.xml","files":["elife-01438-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01438-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
