Here we have developed a novel single-molecule fluorescence approach to directly observe interactions and stoichiometries in protein complexes from cell extracts and from in vitro synthesized components. We show that up to 50 cavins associate on a caveola. However, rather than forming a single coat complex containing the three cavin family members, single-molecule analysis reveals an exquisite specificity of interactions between cavin1, cavin2 and cavin3. Changes in membrane tension can flatten the caveolae, causing the release of the cavin coat and its disassembly into separate cavin1-cavin2 and cavin1-cavin3 subcomplexes. Each of these subcomplexes contain 9 Â± 2 cavin molecules and appear to be the building blocks of the caveolar coat. High resolution immunoelectron microscopy suggests a remarkable nanoscale organization of these separate subcomplexes, forming individual striations on the surface of caveolae.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01434"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01434"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01434","entryfile":"elife-01434-v1.xml","files":["elife-01434-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01434-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
