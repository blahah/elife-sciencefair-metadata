{"title":"pH- and sodium-induced changes in a sodium/proton antiporter","author":[{"surname":"Paulino","given-names":"Cristina"},{"surname":"Kühlbrandt","given-names":"Werner"}],"abstract":"We examined substrate-induced conformational changes in MjNhaP1, an archaeal electroneutral Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-antiporter resembling the human antiporter NHE1, by electron crystallography of 2D crystals in a range of physiological pH and Na<sup>+</sup> conditions. In the absence of sodium, changes in pH had no major effect. By contrast, changes in Na<sup>+</sup> concentration caused a marked conformational change that was largely pH-independent. Crystallographically determined, apparent dissociation constants indicated ∼10-fold stronger Na<sup>+</sup> binding at pH 8 than at pH 4, consistent with substrate competition for a common ion-binding site. Projection difference maps indicated helix movements by about 2 Å in the 6-helix bundle region of MjNhaP1 that is thought to contain the ion translocation site. We propose that these movements convert the antiporter from the proton-bound, outward-open state to the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound, inward-open state. Oscillation between the two states would result in rapid Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01412"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01412"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01412","entryfile":"elife-01412-v1.xml","files":["elife-01412-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01412-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
