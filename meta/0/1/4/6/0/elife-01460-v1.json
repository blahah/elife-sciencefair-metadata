In this study, we identify a microRNA, miR-146a, that is highly upregulated by oncogenic BRAF and NRAS. Expression of miR-146a increases the ability of human melanoma cells to proliferate in culture and form tumors in mice, whereas knockdown of miR-146a has the opposite effects. We show these oncogenic activities are due to miR-146a targeting the NUMB mRNA, a repressor of Notch signaling. Previous studies have shown that pre-miR-146a contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (C>G rs2910164). We find that the ability of pre-miR-146a/G to activate Notch signaling and promote oncogenesis is substantially higher than that of pre-miR-146a/C. Analysis of melanoma cell lines and matched patient samples indicates that during melanoma progression pre-miR-146a/G is enriched relative to pre-miR-146a/C, resulting from a C-to-G somatic mutation in pre-miR-146a/C. Collectively, our results reveal a central role for miR-146a in the initiation and progression of melanoma.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01460"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01460"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01460","entryfile":"elife-01460-v1.xml","files":["elife-01460-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01460-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
