How neuronal architecture influences response properties is unknown. To elucidate the origin of firing patterns in branched mechanoreceptors, we combined neuroanatomy, electrophysiology and computation to analyze mouse slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents. These vertebrate touch receptors, which innervate Merkel cells, encode shape and texture. SAI afferents displayed a high degree of variability in touch-evoked firing and peripheral anatomy. The functional consequence of differences in anatomical architecture was tested by constructing network models representing sequential steps of mechanosensory encoding: skin displacement at touch receptors, mechanotransduction and action-potential initiation. A systematic survey of arbor configurations predicted that the arrangement of mechanotransduction sites at heminodes is a key structural feature that accounts in part for an afferentâ€™s firing properties. These findings identify an anatomical correlate and plausible mechanism to explain the driver effect first described by Adrian and Zotterman.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01488"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01488"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01488","entryfile":"elife-01488-v1.xml","files":["elife-01488-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01488-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01488-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01488-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01488-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01488-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01488-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
