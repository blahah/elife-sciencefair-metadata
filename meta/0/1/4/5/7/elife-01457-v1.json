While a broad T cell repertoire requires diverse positively selecting self-peptides, how a single positively selecting ligand influences naive T cell precursor frequency remains undefined. We generated a transgenic mouse expressing a naturally occurring self-peptide, gp250, that positively selects an MCC-specific TCR, AND, as the only MHC class II I-E<sup>k</sup> ligand to study the MCC highly organized immunodominance hierarchy. The single gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> ligand greatly enhanced MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and skewed MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> population toward V11α<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup>, a major TCR pair in MCC-specific immunodominance. The gp250-selected V11α<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a significantly increased frequency of conserved MCC-preferred CDR3 features. Our studies establish a direct and causal relationship between a selecting self-peptide and the specificity of the selected TCRs. Thus, an immunodominant T cell response can be due to a dominant positively selecting self-peptide.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01457"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01457"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01457","entryfile":"elife-01457-v1.xml","files":["elife-01457-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01457-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01457-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01457-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01457-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01457-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01457-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01457-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
