{"title":"PTRN-1, a microtubule minus end-binding CAMSAP homolog, promotes microtubule function in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neurons","author":[{"surname":"Richardson","given-names":"Claire E"},{"surname":"Spilker","given-names":"Kerri A"},{"surname":"Cueva","given-names":"Juan G"},{"surname":"Perrino","given-names":"John"},{"surname":"Goodman","given-names":"Miriam B"},{"surname":"Shen","given-names":"Kang"}],"abstract":"In neuronal processes, microtubules (MTs) provide structural support and serve as tracks for molecular motors. While it is known that neuronal MTs are more stable than MTs in non-neuronal cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying this stability are not fully understood. In this study, we used live fluorescence microscopy to show that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAMSAP protein PTRN-1 localizes to puncta along neuronal processes, stabilizes MT foci, and promotes MT polymerization in neurites. Electron microscopy revealed that <italic>ptrn-1</italic> null mutants have fewer MTs and abnormal MT organization in the PLM neuron. Animals grown with a MT depolymerizing drug caused synthetic defects in neurite branching in the absence of <italic>ptrn-1</italic> function, indicating that PTRN-1 promotes MT stability. Further, <italic>ptrn-1</italic> null mutants exhibited aberrant neurite morphology and synaptic vesicle localization that is partially dependent on <italic>dlk-1</italic>. Our results suggest that PTRN-1 represents an important mechanism for promoting MT stability in neurons.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01498"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01498"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"02","year":"2014"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01498","entryfile":"elife-01498-v1.xml","files":["elife-01498-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01498-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
