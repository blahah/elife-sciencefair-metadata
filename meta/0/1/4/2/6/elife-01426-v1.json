To this end, we resequenced the four products of 13 meiotic tetrads along with 10 doubled haploids derived from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> hybrids. GC detection through short reads has previously been confounded by genomic rearrangements. Rigid filtering for misaligned reads allowed GC identification at high accuracy and revealed an ∼80-kb transposition, which undergoes copy-number changes mediated by meiotic recombination. Non-crossover associated GCs were extremely rare most likely due to their short average length of ∼25–50 bp, which is significantly shorter than the length of CO-associated GCs. Overall, recombination preferentially targeted non-methylated nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters, which showed significant enrichment of two sequence motifs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"01426"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.01426"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"12","year":"2013"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","path":"01426","entryfile":"elife-01426-v1.xml","files":["elife-01426-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-01426-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
