We have determined the structure of the chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) of IE1 bound to the nucleosome core particle, and discovered that the specific interaction between IE1-CTD and the H2A-H2B acidic patch impairs the compaction of higher-order chromatin structure. Our results suggest that IE1 loosens up the folding of host chromatin during hCMV infections.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11911"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11911"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11911","entryfile":"elife-11911-v3.xml","files":["elife-11911-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11911-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11911-v1.xml","elife-11911-v2.xml"]}
