{"title":"GSK3β regulates AKT-induced central nervous system axon regeneration via an eIF2Bε-dependent, mTORC1-independent pathway","author":[{"surname":"Guo","given-names":"Xinzheng"},{"surname":"Snider","given-names":"William D"},{"surname":"Chen","given-names":"Bo"}],"abstract":"Axons fail to regenerate after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Modulation of the PTEN/mTORC1 pathway in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Here, we report that AKT activation, downstream of <italic>Pten</italic> deletion, promotes axon regeneration and RGC survival. We further demonstrate that GSK3β plays an indispensable role in mediating AKT-induced axon regeneration. Deletion or inactivation of GSK3β promotes axon regeneration independently of the mTORC1 pathway, whereas constitutive activation of GSK3β reduces AKT-induced axon regeneration. Importantly, we have identified eIF2Bε as a novel downstream effector of GSK3β in regulating axon regeneration. Inactivation of eIF2Bε reduces both GSK3β and AKT-mediated effects on axon regeneration. Constitutive activation of eIF2Bε is sufficient to promote axon regeneration. Our results reveal a key role of the AKT-GSK3β-eIF2Bε signaling module in regulating axon regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11903"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11903"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11903","entryfile":"elife-11903-v1.xml","files":["elife-11903-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11903-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
