{"title":"Neural evidence accumulation persists after choice to inform metacognitive judgments","author":[{"surname":"Murphy","given-names":"Peter R"},{"surname":"Robertson","given-names":"Ian H"},{"surname":"Harty","given-names":"Siobhán"},{"surname":"O'Connell","given-names":"Redmond G"}],"abstract":"The ability to revise one’s certainty or confidence in a preceding choice is a critical feature of adaptive decision-making but the neural mechanisms underpinning this metacognitive process have yet to be characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that the same build-to-threshold decision variable signal that triggers an initial choice continues to evolve after commitment, and determines the timing and accuracy of self-initiated error detection reports by selectively representing accumulated evidence that the preceding choice was incorrect. We also show that a peri-choice signal generated in medial frontal cortex provides a source of input to this post-decision accumulation process, indicating that metacognitive judgments are not solely based on the accumulation of feedforward sensory evidence. These findings impart novel insights into the generative mechanisms of metacognition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11946"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11946"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11946","entryfile":"elife-11946-v2.xml","files":["elife-11946-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11946-v1.xml"]}
