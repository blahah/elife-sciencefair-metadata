Yet such descriptions fail to capture the dynamics of decision formation. Describing dynamic neural processes has proven challenging due to the problem of indexing the internal state of PFC and its trial-by-trial variation. Using primate neurophysiology and human magnetoencephalography, we here recover a single-trial index of PFC internal states from multiple simultaneously recorded PFC subregions. This index can explain the origins of neural representations of economic variables in PFC. It describes the relationship between neural dynamics and behaviour in both human and monkey PFC, directly bridging between human neuroimaging data and underlying neuronal activity. Moreover, it reveals a functionally dissociable interaction between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral PFC in guiding cost-benefit decisions. We cast our observations in terms of a recurrent neural network model of choice, providing formal links to mechanistic dynamical accounts of decision-making.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11945"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11945"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11945","entryfile":"elife-11945-v2.xml","files":["elife-11945-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11945-v1.xml"]}
