{"title":"Registered report: Kinase-dead BRAF and oncogenic RAS cooperate to drive tumor progression through CRAF","author":[{"surname":"Bhargava","given-names":"Ajay"},{"surname":"Anant","given-names":"Madan"},{"surname":"Mack","given-names":"Hildegard"}],"abstract":"The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (<xref>Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \"Kinase-dead BRAF and oncogenic RAS cooperate to drive tumor progression through CRAF\" by Heidorn and colleagues, published in <italic>Cell</italic> in 2010 (<xref>Heidorn et al., 2010</xref>). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 1A, 1B, 3A, 3B, and 4D. Heidorn and colleagues report that paradoxical activation of the RAF-RAS-MEK-ERK pathway by BRAF inhibitors when applied to BRAF<sup>WT</sup> cells is a result of BRAF/CRAF heterodimer formation upon inactivation of BRAF kinase activity, and occurs only in the context of active RAS. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11999"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11999"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11999","entryfile":"elife-11999-v1.xml","files":[]}
