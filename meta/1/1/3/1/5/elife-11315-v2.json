{"title":"The ATPases of cohesin interface with regulators to modulate cohesin-mediated DNA tethering","author":[{"surname":"Çamdere","given-names":"Gamze"},{"surname":"Guacci","given-names":"Vincent"},{"surname":"Stricklin","given-names":"Jeremiah"},{"surname":"Koshland","given-names":"Douglas"}],"abstract":"Cohesin tethers together regions of DNA, thereby mediating higher order chromatin organization that is critical for sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. Cohesin contains a heterodimeric ATP-binding Cassette (ABC) ATPase comprised of Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites. These ATPases are required for cohesin to bind DNA. Cohesin’s DNA binding activity is also promoted by the Eco1 acetyltransferase and inhibited by Wpl1. Recently we showed that after cohesin stably binds DNA, a second step is required for DNA tethering. This second step is also controlled by Eco1 acetylation. Here, we use genetic and biochemical analyses to show that this second DNA tethering step is regulated by cohesin ATPase. Furthermore, our results also suggest that Eco1 promotes cohesion by modulating the ATPase cycle of DNA-bound cohesin in a state that is permissive for DNA tethering and refractory to Wpl1 inhibition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11315"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11315"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11315","entryfile":"elife-11315-v2.xml","files":["elife-11315-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig4-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11315-v1.xml"]}
