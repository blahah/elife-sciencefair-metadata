{"title":"ABHD17 proteins are novel protein depalmitoylases that regulate N-Ras palmitate turnover and subcellular localization","author":[{"surname":"Lin","given-names":"David Tse Shen"},{"surname":"Conibear","given-names":"Elizabeth"}],"abstract":"Dynamic changes in protein S-palmitoylation are critical for regulating protein localization and signaling. Only two enzymes - the acyl-protein thioesterases APT1 and APT2 â€“ are known to catalyze palmitate removal from cytosolic cysteine residues. It is unclear if these enzymes act constitutively on all palmitoylated proteins, or if additional depalmitoylases exist. Using a dual pulse-chase strategy comparing palmitate and protein half-lives, we found knockdown or inhibition of APT1 and APT2 blocked depalmitoylation of Huntingtin, but did not affect palmitate turnover on postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) or N-Ras. We used activity profiling to identify novel serine hydrolase targets of the APT1/2 inhibitor Palmostatin B, and discovered that a family of uncharacterized ABHD17 proteins can accelerate palmitate turnover on PSD95 and N-Ras. ABHD17 catalytic activity is required for N-Ras depalmitoylation and re-localization to internal cellular membranes. Our findings indicate that the family of depalmitoylation enzymes may be substantially broader than previously believed.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11306"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11306"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11306","entryfile":"elife-11306-v2.xml","files":["elife-11306-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11306-v1.xml"]}
