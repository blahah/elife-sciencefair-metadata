{"title":"Characterizing a psychiatric symptom dimension related to deficits in goal-directed control","author":[{"surname":"Gillan","given-names":"Claire M"},{"surname":"Kosinski","given-names":"Michal"},{"surname":"Whelan","given-names":"Robert"},{"surname":"Phelps","given-names":"Elizabeth A"},{"surname":"Daw","given-names":"Nathaniel D"}],"abstract":"Prominent theories suggest that compulsive behaviors, characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction, are driven by shared deficits in goal-directed control, which confers vulnerability for developing rigid habits. However, recent studies have shown that deficient goal-directed control accompanies several disorders, including those without an obvious compulsive element. Reasoning that this lack of clinical specificity might reflect broader issues with psychiatric diagnostic categories, we investigated whether a dimensional approach would better delineate the clinical manifestations of goal-directed deficits. Using large-scale online assessment of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive performance in two independent general-population samples, we found that deficits in goal-directed control were most strongly associated with a symptom dimension comprising compulsive behavior and intrusive thought. This association was highly specific when compared to other non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. These data showcase a powerful new methodology and highlight the potential of a dimensional, biologically-grounded approach to psychiatry research.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11305"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11305"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11305","entryfile":"elife-11305-v1.xml","files":["elife-11305-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11305-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11305-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11305-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11305-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11305-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
