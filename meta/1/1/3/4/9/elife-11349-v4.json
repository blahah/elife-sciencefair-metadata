We generated nanobodies against the vertebrate nuclear pore complex (NPC) and used them in STORM imaging to locate individual NPC proteins with <2 nm epitope-label displacement. For this, we introduced cysteines at specific positions in the nanobody sequence and labeled the resulting proteins with fluorophore-maleimides. As nanobodies are normally stabilized by disulfide-bonded cysteines, this appears counterintuitive. Yet, our analysis showed that this caused no folding problems. Compared to traditional NHS ester-labeling of lysines, the cysteine-maleimide strategy resulted in far less background in fluorescence imaging, it better preserved epitope recognition and it is site-specific. We also devised a rapid epitope-mapping strategy, which relies on crosslinking mass spectrometry and the introduced ectopic cysteines. Finally, we used different anti-nucleoporin nanobodies to purify the major NPC building blocks – each in a single step, with native elution and, as demonstrated, in excellent quality for structural analysis by electron microscopy. The presented strategies are applicable to any nanobody and nanobody-target.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11349"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11349"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11349","entryfile":"elife-11349-v4.xml","files":["elife-11349-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig8-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11349-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-11349-v1.xml","elife-11349-v2.xml","elife-11349-v3.xml"]}
