While filoviruses infect diverse mammalian cell lines, we report that cells from African straw-colored fruit bats (<italic>Eidolon helvum</italic>) are refractory to EBOV infection. This could be explained by a single amino acid change in the filovirus receptor, NPC1, which greatly reduces the affinity of EBOV-NPC1 interaction. We found signatures of positive selection in bat <italic>NPC1</italic> concentrated at the virus-receptor interface, with the strongest signal at the same residue that controls EBOV infection in <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> cells. Our work identifies <italic>NPC1</italic> as a genetic determinant of filovirus susceptibility in bats, and suggests that some <italic>NPC1</italic> variations reflect host adaptations to reduce filovirus replication and virulence. A single viral mutation afforded escape from receptor control, revealing a pathway for compensatory viral evolution and a potential avenue for expansion of filovirus host range in nature.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11785"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11785"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"11785","entryfile":"elife-11785-v1.xml","files":["elife-11785-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11785-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
