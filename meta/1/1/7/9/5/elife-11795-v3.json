{"title":"The near-atomic cryoEM structure of a flexible filamentous plant virus shows homology of its coat protein with nucleoproteins of animal viruses","author":[{"surname":"Agirrezabala","given-names":"Xabier"},{"surname":"Méndez-López","given-names":"Eduardo"},{"surname":"Lasso","given-names":"Gorka"},{"surname":"Sánchez-Pina","given-names":"M Amelia"},{"surname":"Aranda","given-names":"Miguel"},{"surname":"Valle","given-names":"Mikel"}],"abstract":"Flexible filamentous viruses include economically important plant pathogens. Their viral particles contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein (CP) protecting a (+)ssRNA. We describe here a structure at 3.9 Å resolution, from electron cryomicroscopy, of <italic>Pepino mosaic virus</italic> (PepMV), a representative of the genus <italic>Potexvirus</italic> (family <italic>Alphaflexiviridae</italic>). Our results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> (family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), a group of enveloped (-)ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein. The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and (-)ssRNA viruses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11795"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11795"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11795","entryfile":"elife-11795-v3.xml","files":["elife-11795-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig1-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig1-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11795-v1.xml","elife-11795-v2.xml"]}
