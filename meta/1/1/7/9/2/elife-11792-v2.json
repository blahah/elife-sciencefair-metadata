{"title":"Spatial sequestration and detoxification of Huntingtin by the ribosome quality control complex","author":[{"surname":"Yang","given-names":"Junsheng"},{"surname":"Hao","given-names":"Xinxin"},{"surname":"Cao","given-names":"Xiuling"},{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Beidong"},{"surname":"Nyström","given-names":"Thomas"}],"abstract":"Huntington disease (HD) is a neurological disorder caused by polyglutamine expansions in mutated Huntingtin (mHtt) proteins, rendering them prone to form inclusion bodies (IB). We report that in yeast, such IB formation is a factor-dependent process subjected to age-related decline. A genome-wide, high-content imaging approach, identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ltn1 of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) as a key factor required for IB formation, ubiquitination, and detoxification of model mHtt. The failure of <italic>ltn1∆</italic> cells to manage mHtt was traced to another RQC component, Tae2, and inappropriate control of heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, activity. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy revealed that mHtt toxicity in RQC-deficient cells was accompanied by multiple mHtt aggregates altering actin cytoskeletal structures and retarding endocytosis. The data demonstrates that spatial sequestration of mHtt into IBs is policed by the RQC-Hsf1 regulatory system and that such compartmentalization, rather than ubiquitination, is key to mHtt detoxification.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11792"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11792"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11792","entryfile":"elife-11792-v2.xml","files":["elife-11792-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11792-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11792-v1.xml"]}
