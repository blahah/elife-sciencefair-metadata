We show that the modification of Ovalbumin (OVA) with the glycan-structure Lewis<sup>X</sup> (Le<sup>X</sup>) re-directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. Le<sup>X</sup>-modification of OVA favored Th1 skewing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, Le<sup>X</sup> modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is MGL1-dependent as shown by reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cell frequencies in MGL1-deficient mice. Moreover, MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> neither required TAP-transporters nor Cathepsin-S and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments. We conclude that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11765"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11765"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11765","entryfile":"elife-11765-v1.xml","files":["elife-11765-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11765-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
