We apply a population genomics approach to examine this effect in an important human pathogen, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic>. We determine that <italic>T.b. gambiense</italic> is evolving strictly asexually and is derived from a single progenitor, which emerged within the last 10,000 years. We demonstrate the Meselson effect for the first time at the genome-wide level in any organism and show large regions of loss of heterozygosity, which we hypothesise to be a short-term compensatory mechanism for counteracting deleterious mutations. Our study sheds new light on the genomic and evolutionary consequences of strict asexuality, which this pathogen uses as it exploits a new biological niche, the human population.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11473"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11473"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11473","entryfile":"elife-11473-v1.xml","files":["elife-11473-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11473-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
