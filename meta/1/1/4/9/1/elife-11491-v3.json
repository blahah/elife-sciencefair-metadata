Despite demonstrations that factors within organs determine their sizes, intrinsic size control mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing size is regulated by JNK signaling during development. JNK is active in a stripe along the center of developing wings, and modulating JNK signaling within this stripe changes organ size. This JNK stripe influences proliferation in a non-canonical, Jun-independent manner by inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Localized JNK activity is established by Hedgehog signaling, where Ci elevates <italic>dTRAF1</italic> expression. As the <italic>dTRAF1</italic> homolog, <italic>TRAF4</italic>, is amplified in numerous cancers, these findings provide a new mechanism for how the Hedgehog pathway could contribute to tumorigenesis, and, more importantly, provides a new strategy for cancer therapies. Finally, modulation of JNK signaling centers in developing antennae and legs changes their sizes, suggesting a more generalizable role for JNK signaling in developmental organ size control.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11491"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11491"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11491","entryfile":"elife-11491-v3.xml","files":["elife-11491-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11491-v1.xml","elife-11491-v2.xml"]}
