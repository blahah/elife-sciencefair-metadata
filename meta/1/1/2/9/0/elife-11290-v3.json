Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity, yet little is known about their role in this process in the adult V1. Activation of MMPs is a crucial step facilitating structural changes in a healthy brain; however, upon brain injury, upregulated MMPs promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. To clarify these seemingly opposing outcomes of MMP-activation, we examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stoke-affected adult mice. In healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity. Additionally, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, normally lost under these conditions. Our data imply that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11290"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11290"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11290","entryfile":"elife-11290-v3.xml","files":["elife-11290-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11290-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11290-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11290-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11290-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11290-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11290-v1.xml","elife-11290-v2.xml"]}
