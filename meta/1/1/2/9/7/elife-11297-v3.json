Pur-alpha-deficient mice die after birth with pleiotropic neuronal defects. Here, we report the crystal structure of the DNA-/RNA-binding domain of Pur-alpha in complex with ssDNA. It reveals base-specific recognition and offers a molecular explanation for the effect of point mutations in the 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome. Consistent with the crystal structure, biochemical and NMR data indicate that Pur-alpha binds DNA and RNA in the same way, suggesting binding modes for tri- and hexanucleotide-repeat RNAs in two neurodegenerative RNAopathies. Additionally, structure-based in vitro experiments resolved the molecular mechanism of Pur-alpha's unwindase activity. Complementing in vivo analyses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrated the importance of a highly conserved phenylalanine for Pur-alpha's unwinding and neuroprotective function. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms of nucleic-acid binding, this study contributes to understanding the cellular role of Pur-alpha and its implications in neurodegenerative diseases.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11297"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11297"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11297","entryfile":"elife-11297-v3.xml","files":["elife-11297-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11297-v1.xml","elife-11297-v2.xml"]}
