They interact with particular viral RNAs, most of them being still unknown. To decipher the viral RNA signature on RLRs during viral infection, we tagged RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2) and applied tagged protein affinity purification followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of associated RNA molecules. Two viruses with negative- and positive-sense RNA genome were used: measles (MV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). NGS analysis revealed that distinct regions of MV genome were specifically recognized by distinct RLRs: RIG-I recognized defective interfering genomes, whereas MDA5 and LGP2 specifically bound MV nucleoprotein-coding region. During CHIKV infection, RIG-I associated specifically to the 3’ untranslated region of viral genome. This study provides the first comparative view of the viral RNA ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 in the presence of infection.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11275"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11275"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11275","entryfile":"elife-11275-v2.xml","files":["elife-11275-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11275-v1.xml"]}
