Extensive phosphorylation of serine residues at the largest RNAPII subunit occurs at its structurally-disordered C-terminal domain (CTD), which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-S<sub>7</sub>. Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, whereas Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7, which can be acetylated (K7ac). Here, we describe mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lysine-7 residues (K7me1 and K7me2). K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11215"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11215"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11215","entryfile":"elife-11215-v2.xml","files":["elife-11215-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11215-v1.xml"]}
