However, its precise function in cancer remains largely uninvestigated. Here we show the clinical significance and metastatic mechanism of NIFK in lung cancer. NIFK expression is clinically associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Furthermore, NIFK enhances Ki-67-dependent proliferation, and promotes migration, invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> via downregulation of casein kinase 1α (CK1α), a suppressor of pro-metastatic TCF4/β-catenin signaling. Inversely, CK1α is upregulated upon NIFK knockdown. The silencing of CK1α expression in NIFK-silenced cells restores TCF4/β-catenin transcriptional activity, cell migration, and metastasis. Furthermore, RUNX1 is identified as a transcription factor of <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> (CK1α) that is negatively regulated by NIFK. Our results demonstrate the prognostic value of NIFK, and suggest that NIFK is required for lung cancer progression via the RUNX1-dependent CK1α repression, which activates TCF4/β-catenin signaling in metastasis and the Ki-67-dependent regulation in cell proliferation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11288"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11288"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11288","entryfile":"elife-11288-v2.xml","files":["elife-11288-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11288-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11288-v1.xml"]}
