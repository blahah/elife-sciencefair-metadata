The sAHP amplitude increases with aging and may underlie age related memory decline. The sAHP is due to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup> conductance, the molecular identity of which has remained elusive until a recent report suggested the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, IK1 (KCNN4) as the sAHP channel in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The signature pharmacology of IK1, blockade by TRAM-34, was reported for the sAHP and underlying current. We have examined the sAHP and find no evidence that TRAM-34 affects either the current underling the sAHP or excitability of CA1 or basolateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. In addition, CA1 pyramidal neurons from IK1 null mice exhibit a characteristic sAHP current. Our results indicate that IK1 channels do not mediate the sAHP in pyramidal neurons.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11206"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11206"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"11206","entryfile":"elife-11206-v1.xml","files":["elife-11206-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11206-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11206-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11206-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11206-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11206-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11206-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
