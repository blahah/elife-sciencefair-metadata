{"title":"Localized epigenetic silencing of a damage-activated WNT enhancer limits regeneration in mature <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs","author":[{"surname":"Harris","given-names":"Robin E"},{"surname":"Setiawan","given-names":"Linda"},{"surname":"Saul","given-names":"Josh"},{"surname":"Hariharan","given-names":"Iswar K"}],"abstract":"Many organisms lose the capacity to regenerate damaged tissues as they mature. Damaged <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs regenerate efficiently early in the third larval instar (L3) but progressively lose this ability. This correlates with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes, including the WNT genes <italic>wingless (wg</italic>) and <italic>Wnt6</italic>. We demonstrate that damage-responsive expression of both genes requires a bipartite enhancer whose activity declines during L3. Within this enhancer, a damage-responsive module stays active throughout L3, while an adjacent silencing element nucleates increasing levels of epigenetic silencing restricted to this enhancer. Cas9-mediated deletion of the silencing element alleviates WNT repression, but is, in itself, insufficient to promote regeneration. However, directing <italic>Myc</italic> expression to the blastema overcomes repression of multiple genes, including <italic>wg</italic>, and restores cellular responses necessary for regeneration. Localized epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can therefore restrict regenerative capacity in maturing organisms without compromising gene functions regulated by developmental signals.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11588"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11588"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11588","entryfile":"elife-11588-v2.xml","files":["elife-11588-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11588-v1.xml"]}
