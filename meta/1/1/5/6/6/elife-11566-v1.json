The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link>citations and Altmetric scores</ext-link> (<xref>Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \"Diverse somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in human cancers\" by Kan and colleagues published in <italic>Nature</italic> in 2010 (<xref>Kan et al., 2010</xref>). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3D-F and 4C-F. Kan and colleagues utilized mismatch repair detection (MRD) technology to identify somatic mutations in primary human tumor samples and identified a previously uncharacterized arginine 243 to histidine (R243H) mutation in the G-protein Î± subunit <italic>GNAO1</italic> in breast carcinoma tissue. In Figures 3D-F, Kan and colleagues demonstrated that stable expression of mutant <italic>GNAO1</italic> conferred a significant growth advantage in human mammary epithelial cells, confirming the oncogenic potential of this mutation. Similarly, expression of variants with somatic mutations in <italic>MAP2K4</italic>, a JNK pathway kinase (shown in Figures 4C-E) resulted in a significant increase in anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, these mutants exhibited reduced kinase activity compared to wild type <italic>MAP2K4</italic>, indicating these mutations impose a dominant-negative influence to promote growth (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link>Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link>Science Exchange</ext-link> and the results of the replications will be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11566"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11566"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11566","entryfile":"elife-11566-v1.xml","files":[]}
