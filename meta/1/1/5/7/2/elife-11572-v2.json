In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, leg motoneurons are organized as a myotopic map, where their dendritic domains represent the muscle field. Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying development of aspects of this myotopic map, required for walking. A behavioral screen identified roles for Semaphorins (Sema) and Plexins (Plex) in walking behavior. Deciphering this phenotype, we show that PlexA/Sema1a mediates motoneuron axon branching in ways that differ in the proximal femur and distal tibia, based on motoneuronal birth order. Importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; PlexB/Sema2a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons. These findings indicate that communication within motoneurons and between glia and motoneurons, mediated by the combined action of different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems, are required for the formation of a functional myotopic map.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11572"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11572"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11572","entryfile":"elife-11572-v2.xml","files":["elife-11572-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11572-v1.xml"]}
