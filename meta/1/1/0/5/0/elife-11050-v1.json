Recent crystal structures solved in apo and ATP-bound states revealed molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding. However, the mechanism of pore opening still remains controversial. Here we use photo-switchable cross-linkers as ‘molecular tweezers’ to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints combined with computational studies provide high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. We show that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Our data further reveal that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11050"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11050"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11050","entryfile":"elife-11050-v1.xml","files":["elife-11050-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11050-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
