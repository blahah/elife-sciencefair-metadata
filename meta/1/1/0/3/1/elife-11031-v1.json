{"title":"Integrative neuromechanics of crawling in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae","author":[{"surname":"Pehlevan","given-names":"Cengiz"},{"surname":"Paoletti","given-names":"Paolo"},{"surname":"Mahadevan","given-names":"L"}],"abstract":"Locomotion in an organism is a consequence of the coupled interaction between brain, body and environment. Motivated by qualitative observations and quantitative perturbations of crawling in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae, we construct a minimal integrative mathematical model for its locomotion. Our model couples the excitation-inhibition circuits in the nervous system to force production in the muscles and body movement in a frictional environment, thence linking neural dynamics to body mechanics via sensory feedback in a heterogeneous environment. Our results explain the basic observed phenomenology of crawling with and without proprioception, and elucidate the stabilizing role that proprioception plays in producing a robust crawling phenotype in the presence of biological perturbations. More generally, our approach allows us to make testable predictions on the effect of changing body-environment interactions on crawling, and serves as a step in the development of hierarchical models linking cellular processes to behavior.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11031"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11031"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11031","entryfile":"elife-11031-v1.xml","files":["elife-11031-app1-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11031-app2-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11031-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11031-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11031-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11031-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11031-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11031-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
