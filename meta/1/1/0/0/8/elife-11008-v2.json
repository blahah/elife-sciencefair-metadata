Growth cones are attracted to intermediate targets, but they must switch their response upon arrival so that they can move away and complete the next stage of growth. Here, we show that KPC-1, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> Furin homolog, regulates the level of the branching receptor DMA-1 on dendrites by targeting it to late endosomes. In <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants, the level of DMA-1 is abnormally high on dendrites, resulting in trapping of dendrites at locations where a high level of the cognate ligand, the adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1, is present. The misregulation of DMA-1 also causes dendritic self-avoidance defects. Thus, precise regulation of guidance receptors creates flexibility of responses to guidance signals and is critical for neuronal morphogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11008"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11008"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11008","entryfile":"elife-11008-v2.xml","files":["elife-11008-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11008-v1.xml"]}
