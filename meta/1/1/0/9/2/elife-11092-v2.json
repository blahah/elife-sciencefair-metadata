{"title":"Odor-identity dependent motor programs underlie behavioral responses to odors","author":[{"surname":"Jung","given-names":"Seung-Hye"},{"surname":"Hueston","given-names":"Catherine"},{"surname":"Bhandawat","given-names":"Vikas"}],"abstract":"All animals use olfactory information to perform tasks essential to their survival. Odors typically activate multiple olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) classes and are therefore represented by the patterns of active ORNs. How the patterns of active ORN classes are decoded to drive behavior is under intense investigation. In this study, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system, we investigate the logic by which odors modulate locomotion. We designed a novel behavioral arena in which we could examine a flyâ€™s locomotion under precisely controlled stimulus condition. In this arena, in response to similarly attractive odors, flies modulate their locomotion differently implying that odors have a more diverse effect on locomotion than was anticipated. Three features underlie odor-guided locomotion: First, in response to odors, flies modulate a surprisingly large number of motor parameters. Second, similarly attractive odors elicit changes in different motor programs. Third, different ORN classes modulate different subset of motor parameters.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11092"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11092"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11092","entryfile":"elife-11092-v2.xml","files":["elife-11092-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11092-v1.xml"]}
