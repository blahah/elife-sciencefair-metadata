Our understanding of how genetic and epigenetic modes of regulation work together to establish and maintain cellular identity is still limited, however. Here, we show that <italic>DNA methyltransferase 3bb.1</italic> (<italic>dnmt3bb.1</italic>) is essential for maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) fate as part of an early <italic>Notch-runx1-cmyb</italic> HSPC specification pathway in the zebrafish. Dnmt3bb.1 is expressed in HSPC downstream from <italic>Notch1</italic> and <italic>runx1</italic>, and loss of Dnmt3bb.1 activity leads to reduced <italic>cmyb</italic> locus methylation, reduced <italic>cmyb</italic> expression, and gradual reduction in HSPCs. Ectopic overexpression of <italic>dnmt3bb.1</italic> in non-hematopoietic cells is sufficient to methylate the <italic>cmyb</italic> locus, promote <italic>cmyb</italic> expression, and promote hematopoietic development. Our results reveal an epigenetic mechanism supporting the maintenance of hematopoietic cell fate via DNA methylation-mediated perdurance of a key transcription factor in HSPCs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11813"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11813"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"11813","entryfile":"elife-11813-v1.xml","files":["elife-11813-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11813-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
