The stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been controversial with studies reporting either a strict 2 KCNE1:4 KCNQ1 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. We used <italic>I</italic> fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one (EQ), two (EQQ) or four (EQQQQ) KCNQ1 subunits, to reproduce compulsory 4:4, 2:4 or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed EQQ and EQQQQ to have increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ - all abolished by the addition of KCNE1. As well, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, we found EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates to be progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, which demonstrates that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the <italic>I</italic> complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11815"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11815"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11815","entryfile":"elife-11815-v2.xml","files":["elife-11815-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig1-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig2-figsupp1-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig2-figsupp2-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig2-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig3-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig4-figsupp1-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig4-figsupp2-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig4-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig5-figsupp1-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig5-figsupp2-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig5-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-fig6-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-resp-fig1-v2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11815-v1.xml","elife-11815-v2-v2.xml"]}
