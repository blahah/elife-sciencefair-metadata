This level of understanding has allowed their manipulation in unprecedented detail. They do not seem a likely source of surprises, yet we describe here the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. Our results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11861"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11861"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11861","entryfile":"elife-11861-v2.xml","files":["elife-11861-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11861-v1.xml"]}
