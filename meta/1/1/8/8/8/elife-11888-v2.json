Such blooms can trigger secondary blooms of planktonic bacteria that consist of swift successions of distinct bacterial clades, most prominently members of the <italic>Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria</italic> and the alphaproteobacterial <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade. We investigated such successions during spring phytoplankton blooms in the southern North Sea (German Bight) for four consecutive years. Dense sampling and high-resolution taxonomic analyses allowed the detection of recurring patterns down to the genus level. Metagenome analyses also revealed recurrent patterns at the functional level, in particular with respect to algal polysaccharide degradation genes. We, therefore, hypothesize that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is largely governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11888"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11888"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11888","entryfile":"elife-11888-v2.xml","files":["elife-11888-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11888-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11888-v1.xml"]}
