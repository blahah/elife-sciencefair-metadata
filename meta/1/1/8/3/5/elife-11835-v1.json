To address this issue, we used three complementary experimental approaches to monitor phosphorylation and SH2 binding in human A431 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF): 1) phospho-specific mass spectrometry; 2) far-Western blotting; and 3) live cell single-molecule imaging of SH2 membrane recruitment. Far-Western and MS analyses identified both well-established and previously undocumented EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and binding events, as well as dynamic changes in binding patterns over time. In comparing SH2 binding site phosphorylation with SH2 domain membrane recruitment in living cells, we found in vivo binding to be much slower. Delayed SH2 domain recruitment correlated with clustering of SH2 domain binding sites on the membrane, consistent with membrane retention via SH2 rebinding.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11835"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11835"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11835","entryfile":"elife-11835-v1.xml","files":["elife-11835-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11835-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
