Here we report structures of complexes formed by the DD of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) with RhoGDI, for activation of the RhoA pathway, with caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIP2 kinase, for activation of the NF-kB pathway, and with itself, revealing how DD dimerization controls access of intracellular effectors to the receptor. RIP2 CARD and RhoGDI bind to p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD at partially overlapping epitopes with over 100-fold difference in affinity, revealing the mechanism by which RIP2 recruitment displaces RhoGDI upon ligand binding. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD forms non-covalent, low-affinity symmetric dimers in solution. The dimer interface overlaps with RIP2 CARD but not RhoGDI binding sites, supporting a model of receptor activation triggered by separation of DDs. These structures reveal how competitive protein-protein interactions orchestrate the hierarchical activation of downstream pathways in non-catalytic receptors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11692"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11692"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11692","entryfile":"elife-11692-v2.xml","files":["elife-11692-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11692-v1.xml"]}
