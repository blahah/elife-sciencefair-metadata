Here we show that the <italic>osm-9</italic> TRPV channel gene is a target of developmental programming and is down-regulated specifically in the ADL chemosensory neurons of postdauer adults, resulting in a corresponding altered olfactory behavior that is mediated by ADL in an OSM-9-dependent manner. We identify a <italic>cis</italic>-acting motif bound by the DAF-3 SMAD and ZFP-1 (AF10) proteins that is necessary for the differential regulation of <italic>osm-9,</italic> and demonstrate that both chromatin remodeling and endo-siRNA pathways are major contributors to the transcriptional silencing of the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus. This work describes an elegant mechanism by which developmental experience influences adult phenotypes by establishing and maintaining transcriptional changes via RNAi and chromatin remodeling pathways.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11642"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11642"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11642","entryfile":"elife-11642-v1.xml","files":["elife-11642-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11642-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
