How polarizing signals coordinate metabolic and functional reprogramming, and the potential implications for control of macrophage activation, remains poorly understood. Here we show that IL-4 signaling co-opts the Akt-mTORC1 pathway to regulate Acly, a key enzyme in Ac-CoA synthesis, leading to increased histone acetylation and M2 gene induction. Only a subset of M2 genes is controlled in this way, including those regulating cellular proliferation and chemokine production. Moreover, metabolic signals impinge on the Akt-mTORC1 axis for such control of M2 activation. We propose that Akt-mTORC1 signaling calibrates metabolic state to energetically demanding aspects of M2 activation, which may define a new role for metabolism in supporting macrophage activation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11612"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11612"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11612","entryfile":"elife-11612-v1.xml","files":["elife-11612-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11612-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
