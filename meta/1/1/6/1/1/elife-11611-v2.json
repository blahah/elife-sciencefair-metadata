Cdc42 and related GTPases are activated and accumulate in a patch of the cortex that defines the front of the cell. Positive feedback enables spontaneous polarization triggered by stochastic fluctuations, but as such fluctuations can occur at multiple locations, how do cells ensure that they make only one front? In polarizing cells of the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, positive feedback can trigger growth of several Cdc42 clusters at the same time, but this multi-cluster stage rapidly evolves to a single-cluster state, which then promotes bud emergence. By manipulating polarity protein dynamics, we show that resolution of multi-cluster intermediates occurs through a greedy competition between clusters to recruit and retain polarity proteins from a shared intracellular pool.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11611"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11611"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11611","entryfile":"elife-11611-v2.xml","files":["elife-11611-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11611-v1.xml"]}
