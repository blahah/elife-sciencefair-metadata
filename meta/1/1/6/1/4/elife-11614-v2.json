To identify dosage-sensitive genes that cause DS phenotypes, including CHD, we used chromosome engineering to generate a mapping panel of 7 mouse strains with partial trisomies of regions of mouse chromosome 16 orthologous to Hsa21. Using high-resolution episcopic microscopy and three-dimensional modeling we show that these strains accurately model DS CHD. Systematic analysis of the 7 strains identified a minimal critical region sufficient to cause CHD when present in 3 copies, and showed that it contained at least two dosage-sensitive loci. Furthermore, two of these new strains model a specific subtype of atrio-ventricular septal defects with exclusive ventricular shunting and demonstrate that, contrary to current hypotheses, these CHD are not due to failure in formation of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11614"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11614"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11614","entryfile":"elife-11614-v2.xml","files":["elife-11614-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11614-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11614-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11614-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11614-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11614-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11614-v1.xml"]}
