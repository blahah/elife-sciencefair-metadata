Monomers and oligomers of the M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor therefore have been compared to identify those allosteric properties that are gained in oligomers. Allosteric interactions were monitored by means of a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and in pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. Allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending upon the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and they arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11685"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11685"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11685","entryfile":"elife-11685-v2.xml","files":["elife-11685-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11685-v1.xml"]}
