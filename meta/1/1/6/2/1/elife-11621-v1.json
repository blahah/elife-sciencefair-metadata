Because Wnts are lipidated and highly hydrophobic, they can only be purified in the presence of detergents, limiting their use in various in vitro and in vivo assays. We purified N-terminally tagged recombinant Wnt3a secreted from cells and accidentally discovered that Wnt3a co-purified with a glycoprotein afamin derived from the bovine serum included in the media. Wnt3a forms a 1:1 complex with afamin, which remains soluble in aqueous buffer after isolation, and can induce signaling in various cellular systems including the intestical stem cell growth assay. By co-expressing with afamin, biologically active afamin-Wnt complex can be easily obtained in large quantity. As afamin can also solubilize Wnt5a, Wnt3, and many more Wnt subtypes, afamin complexation will open a way to put various Wnt ligands and their signaling mechanisms under a thorough biochemical scrutiny that had been difficult for years.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11621"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11621"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11621","entryfile":"elife-11621-v1.xml","files":["elife-11621-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11621-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
