{"title":"Catalysis-dependent selenium incorporation and migration in the nitrogenase active site iron-molybdenum cofactor","author":[{"surname":"Spatzal","given-names":"Thomas"},{"surname":"Perez","given-names":"Kathryn A"},{"surname":"Howard","given-names":"James B"},{"surname":"Rees","given-names":"Douglas C"}],"abstract":"Dinitrogen reduction in the biological nitrogen cycle is catalyzed by nitrogenase, a two-component metalloenzyme. Understanding of the transformation of the inert resting state of the active site FeMo-cofactor into an activated state capable of reducing dinitrogen remains elusive. Here we report the catalysis dependent, site-selective incorporation of selenium into the FeMo-cofactor from selenocyanate as a newly identified substrate and inhibitor. The 1.60 Å resolution structure reveals selenium occupying the S2B site of FeMo-cofactor in the <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> MoFe-protein, a position that was recently identified as the CO-binding site. The Se2B-labeled enzyme retains substrate reduction activity and marks the starting point for a crystallographic pulse-chase experiment of the active site during turnover. Through a series of crystal structures obtained at resolutions of 1.32–1.66 Å, including the CO-inhibited form of Av1-Se2B, the exchangeability of all three belt-sulfur sites is demonstrated, providing direct insights into unforeseen rearrangements of the metal center during catalysis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11620"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11620"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11620","entryfile":"elife-11620-v2.xml","files":["elife-11620-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11620-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11620-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11620-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11620-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11620-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11620-v1.xml"]}
