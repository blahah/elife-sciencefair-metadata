Genome-wide association studies have identified Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. We report that <italic>Meis1</italic> inactivation in the mouse neural crest leads to an altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults characterized by a chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects, thus increasing the susceptibility to SCD. We demonstrated that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that <italic>Meis1</italic> deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages. In addition, we showed that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery. Accordingly, the traffic of Rab5<sup>+</sup> endosomes is severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. These results suggest that <italic>Meis1</italic> interacts with various trophic factors signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11627"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11627"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11627","entryfile":"elife-11627-v1.xml","files":["elife-11627-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11627-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
