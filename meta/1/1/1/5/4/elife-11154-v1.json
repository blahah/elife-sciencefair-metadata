{"title":"The ribosomal protein Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of short mRNAs","author":[{"surname":"Thompson","given-names":"Mary K"},{"surname":"Rojas-Duran","given-names":"Maria F"},{"surname":"Gangaramani","given-names":"Paritosh"},{"surname":"Gilbert","given-names":"Wendy V"}],"abstract":"Translation is a core cellular process carried out by a highly conserved macromolecular machine, the ribosome. There has been remarkable evolutionary adaptation of this machine through the addition of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins whose individual effects on ribosome function are largely unknown. Here we show that eukaryote-specific Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs with short open reading frames that show greater than average translational efficiency in diverse eukaryotes. <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> display compromised translation of specific functional groups, including cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and display cellular phenotypes consistent with their gene-specific translation defects. Asc1-sensitive mRNAs are preferentially associated with the translational ‘closed loop’ complex comprised of eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1, and depletion of eIF4G mimics the translational defects of <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants. Together our results reveal a role for Asc1/RACK1 in a length-dependent initiation mechanism optimized for efficient translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11154"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11154"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11154","entryfile":"elife-11154-v1.xml","files":["elife-11154-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11154-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
