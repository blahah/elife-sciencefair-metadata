They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-κB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11156"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11156"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11156","entryfile":"elife-11156-v3.xml","files":["elife-11156-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-11156-v1.xml","elife-11156-v2.xml"]}
