Here, we investigated structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion using various biophysical experiments including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions fold to contain a circumscribed central cavity. Interestingly, we showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin, which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion, and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11184"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11184"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11184","entryfile":"elife-11184-v2.xml","files":["elife-11184-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11184-v1.xml"]}
