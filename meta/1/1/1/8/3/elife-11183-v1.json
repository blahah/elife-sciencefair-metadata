{"title":"The <italic>Drosophila</italic> HNF4 nuclear receptor promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and mitochondrial function in adults","author":[{"surname":"Barry","given-names":"William E"},{"surname":"Thummel","given-names":"Carl S"}],"abstract":"Although mutations in <italic>HNF4A</italic> were identified as the cause of Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young 1 (MODY1) two decades ago, the mechanisms by which this nuclear receptor regulates glucose homeostasis remain unclear. Here we report that loss of <italic>Drosophila HNF4</italic> recapitulates hallmark symptoms of MODY1, including adult-onset hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). These defects are linked to a role for dHNF4 in promoting mitochondrial function as well as the expression of <italic>Hex-C</italic>, a homolog of the MODY2 gene <italic>Glucokinase. dHNF4</italic> is required in the fat body and insulin-producing cells to maintain glucose homeostasis by supporting a developmental switch toward oxidative phosphorylation and GSIS at the transition to adulthood. These findings establish an animal model for MODY1 and define a developmental reprogramming of metabolism to support the energetic needs of the mature animal.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11183"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11183"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11183","entryfile":"elife-11183-v1.xml","files":["elife-11183-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11183-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
