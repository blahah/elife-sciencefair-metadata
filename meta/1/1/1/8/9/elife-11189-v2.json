Crystal structures have suggested that the conformational change from occluded to outward-facing states is unusually simple, involving only the rotation of a conserved glutamate (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) upon its protonation. Using <sup>19</sup>F NMR, we show that as [H<sup>+</sup>] is increased to protonate Glu<sub>ex</sub> and enrich the outward-facing state, a residue ~20 Å away from Glu<sub>ex</sub>, near the subunit interface, moves from buried to solvent-exposed. Consistent with functional relevance of this motion, constriction via inter-subunit cross-linking reduces transport. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cross-link dampens extracellular gate-opening motions. In support of this model, mutations that decrease steric contact between Helix N (part of the extracellular gate) and Helix P (at the subunit interface) remove the inhibitory effect of the cross-link. Together, these results demonstrate the formation of a previously uncharacterized 'outward-facing open' state, and highlight the relevance of global structural changes in CLC function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11189"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11189"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11189","entryfile":"elife-11189-v2.xml","files":["elife-11189-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-11189-v1.xml"]}
