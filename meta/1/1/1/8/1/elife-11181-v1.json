{"title":"Bitter taste receptors confer diverse functions to neurons","author":[{"surname":"Delventhal","given-names":"Rebecca"},{"surname":"Carlson","given-names":"John R"}],"abstract":"Bitter compounds elicit an aversive response. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> bitter-sensitive taste neurons coexpress many members of the Gr family of taste receptors. However, the molecular logic of bitter signaling is unknown. We used an in vivo expression approach to analyze the logic of bitter taste signaling. Ectopic or overexpression of bitter Grs increased endogenous responses or conferred novel responses. Surprisingly, expression of Grs also suppressed many endogenous bitter responses. Conversely, deletion of an endogenous <italic>Gr</italic> led to novel responses. Expression of individual Grs conferred strikingly different effects in different neurons. The results support a model in which bitter Grs interact, exhibiting competition, inhibition, or activation. The results have broad implications for the problem of how taste systems evolve to detect new environmental dangers.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11181"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11181"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11181","entryfile":"elife-11181-v1.xml","files":["elife-11181-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig11-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11181-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
