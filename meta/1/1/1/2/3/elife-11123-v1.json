Here, we have determined the functions of ERK/MAPK signaling in developing neocortical excitatory neurons. Our data reveal a critical requirement for ERK/MAPK signaling in the morphological development and survival of large Ctip2<sup>+</sup> neurons in layer 5. Loss of <italic>Map2k1/2 (Mek1/2)</italic> led to deficits in corticospinal tract formation and subsequent corticospinal neuron apoptosis. ERK/MAPK hyperactivation also led to reduced corticospinal axon elongation, but was associated with enhanced arborization. ERK/MAPK signaling was dispensable for axonal outgrowth of layer 2/3 callosal neurons. However, <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> deletion led to reduced expression of Arc and enhanced intrinsic excitability in both layers 2/3 and 5, in addition to imbalanced synaptic excitation and inhibition. These data demonstrate selective requirements for ERK/MAPK signaling in layer 5 circuit development and general effects on cortical pyramidal neuron excitability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"11123"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.11123"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"11123","entryfile":"elife-11123-v1.xml","files":["elife-11123-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-11123-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
