Here, we present two high-resolution structures of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> XerH with its recombination site DNA <italic>dif</italic>, representing pre-cleavage and post-cleavage synaptic intermediates in the recombination pathway. The structures reveal that activation of DNA strand cleavage and rejoining involves large conformational changes and DNA bending, suggesting how interaction with the cell division protein FtsK may license recombination at the septum. Together with biochemical and in vivo analysis, our structures also reveal how a small sequence asymmetry in <italic>dif</italic> defines protein conformation in the synaptic complex and orchestrates the order of DNA strand exchanges. Our results provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of Xer recombination and a model for regulation of recombination activity during cell division.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19706"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19706"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19706","entryfile":"elife-19706-v2.xml","files":["elife-19706-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19706-v1.xml"]}
