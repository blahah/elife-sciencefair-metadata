Here, we build on this observation with a comprehensive algorithm that incorporates chromatin, position, and sequence features to accurately predict highly effective single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for targeting nuclease-dead Cas9-mediated transcriptional repression (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa). We use this algorithm to design next-generation genome-scale CRISPRi and CRISPRa libraries targeting human and mouse genomes. A CRISPRi screen for essential genes in K562 cells demonstrates that the large majority of sgRNAs are highly active. We also find CRISPRi does not exhibit any detectable non-specific toxicity recently observed with CRISPR nuclease approaches. Precision-recall analysis shows that we detect over 90% of essential genes with minimal false positives using a compact 5 sgRNA/gene library. Our results establish CRISPRi and CRISPRa as premier tools for loss- or gain-of-function studies and provide a general strategy for identifying Cas9 target sites.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19760"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19760"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19760","entryfile":"elife-19760-v2.xml","files":["elife-19760-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19760-v1.xml"]}
