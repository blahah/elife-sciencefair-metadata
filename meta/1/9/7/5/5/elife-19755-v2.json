Here, we identified an atypical protease of the subtilase family [SBT5.2(b)] that attenuates the transcriptional activation of plant defence independently of its protease activity. The <italic>SBT5.2</italic> gene produces two distinct transcripts encoding a canonical secreted subtilase [SBT5.2(a)] and an intracellular protein [SBT5.2(b)]. Concomitant to <italic>SBT5.2(a)</italic> downregulation, <italic>SBT5.2(b)</italic> expression is induced after bacterial inoculation. SBT5.2(b) localizes to endosomes where it interacts with and retains the defence-related transcription factor MYB30. Nuclear exclusion of MYB30 results in its reduced transcriptional activation and, thus, suppressed resistance. <italic>sbt5.2</italic> mutants, with abolished <italic>SBT5.2(a)</italic> and <italic>SBT5.2(b)</italic> expression, display enhanced defence that is suppressed in a <italic>myb30</italic> mutant background. Moreover, overexpression of SBT5.2(b), but not SBT5.2(a), in <italic>sbt5.2</italic> plants reverts the phenotypes displayed by <italic>sbt5.2</italic> mutants. Overall, we uncover a regulatory mode of the transcriptional activation of defence responses previously undescribed in eukaryotes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19755"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19755"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19755","entryfile":"elife-19755-v2.xml","files":["elife-19755-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19755-v1.xml"]}
