However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation, and resulting increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19720"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19720"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19720","entryfile":"elife-19720-v1.xml","files":["elife-19720-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19720-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
