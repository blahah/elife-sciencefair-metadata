{"title":"NMNAT1 inhibits axon degeneration via blockade of SARM1-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion","author":[{"surname":"Sasaki","given-names":"Yo"},{"surname":"Nakagawa","given-names":"Takashi"},{"surname":"Mao","given-names":"Xianrong"},{"surname":"DiAntonio","given-names":"Aaron"},{"surname":"Milbrandt","given-names":"Jeffrey"}],"abstract":"Overexpression of the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1 leads to preservation of injured axons. While increased NAD<sup>+</sup> or decreased NMN levels are thought to be critical to this process, the mechanism(s) of this axon protection remain obscure. Using steady-state and flux analysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites in healthy and injured mouse dorsal root ganglion axons, we find that rather than altering NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis, NMNAT1 instead blocks the injury-induced, SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption that is central to axon degeneration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19749"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19749"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19749","entryfile":"elife-19749-v2.xml","files":["elife-19749-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19749-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19749-v1.xml"]}
