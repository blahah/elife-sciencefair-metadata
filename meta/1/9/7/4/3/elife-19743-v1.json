We found that PTBP1 binding in the flanking introns allowed normal U2AF and U1 snRNP binding to the target exon splice sites but blocked U2 snRNP assembly in HeLa nuclear extract. Characterizing a purified PTBP1-repressed complex, as well as an active early complex and the final EDC by SILAC-MS, we identified extensive PTBP1-modulated changes in exon RNP composition. The active early complex formed in the absence of PTBP1 proceeded to assemble an EDC with the eviction of hnRNP proteins, the late recruitment of SR proteins, and binding of the U2 snRNP. These results demonstrate that during early stages of splicing, exon RNP complexes are highly dynamic with many proteins failing to bind during PTBP1 arrest.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19743"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19743"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19743","entryfile":"elife-19743-v1.xml","files":["elife-19743-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19743-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
