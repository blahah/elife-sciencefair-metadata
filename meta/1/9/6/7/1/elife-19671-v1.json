Current strategies to circumvent resistance target the same or parallel pathways. We report here that targeting a completely different process, autophagy, can overcome multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms in brain tumors. <italic>BRAF</italic>mutations occur in many pediatric brain tumors. We previously reported that these tumors are autophagy-dependent and a patient was successfully treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine after failure of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor vemurafenib, suggesting autophagy inhibition overcame the kinase inhibitor resistance. We tested this hypothesis in vemurafenib-resistant brain tumors. Genetic and pharmacological autophagy inhibition overcame molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms, inhibited tumor cell growth, and increased cell death. Patients with resistance had favorable clinical responses when chloroquine was added to vemurafenib. This provides a fundamentally different strategy to circumvent multiple mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance that could be rapidly tested in clinical trials in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic> brain tumors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19671"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19671"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19671","entryfile":"elife-19671-v1.xml","files":["elife-19671-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19671-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
