Actin is a DAMP detected in mammals by the receptor, DNGR-1, expressed by dendritic cells (DCs). DNGR-1 is phosphorylated by Src-family kinases and recruits the tyrosine kinase Syk to promote DC cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens. Here we report that actin is also a DAMP in invertebrates that lack DCs and adaptive immunity. Administration of actin to <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> triggers a response characterised by selective induction of STAT target genes in the fat body through the cytokine Upd3 and its JAK/STAT-coupled receptor, Domeless. Notably, this response requires signalling via Shark, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of Syk, and Src42A, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Src-family kinase, and is dependent on Nox activity. Thus, extracellular actin detection via a Src-family kinase-dependent cascade is an ancient means of detecting cell injury that precedes the evolution of adaptive immunity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19662"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19662"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19662","entryfile":"elife-19662-v3.xml","files":["elife-19662-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19662-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19662-v1.xml","elife-19662-v2.xml"]}
