For palmitoylation to occur, membrane association is a prerequisite, but it is unclear which motif may increase the affinities of the proteins for the target membrane. In experiments with rat neuroendocrine cells, we find that a few basic amino acids in the cysteine-rich region of SNAP25 and SNAP23 are essential for plasma membrane targeting. Reconstitution of membrane-protein binding in a liposome assay shows that the mechanism involves protein electrostatics between basic amino acid residues and acidic lipids such as phosphoinositides that play a primary role in these interactions. Hence, we identify an electrostatic anchoring mechanism underlying initial plasma membrane contact by SNARE proteins, which subsequently become palmitoylated at the plasma membrane.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19394"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19394"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19394","entryfile":"elife-19394-v3.xml","files":["elife-19394-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-resp-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19394-v1.xml","elife-19394-v2.xml"]}
