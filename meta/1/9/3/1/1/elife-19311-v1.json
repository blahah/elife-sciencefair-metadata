{"title":"Neuronal cell fate diversification controlled by sub-temporal action of <italic>Kruppel</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Stratmann","given-names":"Johannes"},{"surname":"Gabilondo","given-names":"Hugo"},{"surname":"Benito-Sipos","given-names":"Jonathan"},{"surname":"Thor","given-names":"Stefan"}],"abstract":"During <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic nervous system development, neuroblasts express a programmed cascade of five temporal transcription factors that govern the identity of cells generated at different time-points. However, these five temporal genes fall short of accounting for the many distinct cell types generated in large lineages. Here, we find that the late temporal gene <italic>castor</italic> sub-divides its large window in neuroblast 5–6 by simultaneously activating two cell fate determination cascades and a sub-temporal regulatory program. The sub-temporal program acts both upon itself and upon the determination cascades to diversify the <italic>castor</italic> window. Surprisingly, the early temporal gene <italic>Kruppel</italic> acts as one of the sub-temporal genes within the late <italic>castor</italic> window. Intriguingly, while the temporal gene <italic>castor</italic> activates the two determination cascades and the sub-temporal program, spatial cues controlling cell fate in the latter part of the 5–6 lineage exclusively act upon the determination cascades.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19311"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19311"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19311","entryfile":"elife-19311-v1.xml","files":["elife-19311-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19311-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
