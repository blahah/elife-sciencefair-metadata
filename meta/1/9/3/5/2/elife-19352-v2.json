Here we show that seizures result in a severe hypoxic attack confined to the postictal period. We measured brain oxygenation in localized areas from freely-moving rodents and discovered a severe hypoxic event (pO<sub>2</sub> < 10 mmHg) after the termination of seizures. This event lasted over an hour, is mediated by hypoperfusion, generalizes to people with epilepsy, and is attenuated by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channels. Using inhibitors of these targets we separated the seizure from the resulting severe hypoxia and show that structure specific postictal memory and behavioral impairments are the consequence of this severe hypoperfusion/hypoxic event. Thus, epilepsy is much more than a disease hallmarked by seizures, since the occurrence of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia results in a separate set of neurological consequences that are currently not being treated and are preventable.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19352"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19352"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19352","entryfile":"elife-19352-v2.xml","files":["elife-19352-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19352-v1.xml"]}
