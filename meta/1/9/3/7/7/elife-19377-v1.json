A traditional, centuries-old rice agro-system of the Yuanyang terraces was used as a model to show that virulence effectors of the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzaeh</italic> play a key role in its specialization on locally grown indica or japonica local rice subspecies. Our results have indicated that major differences in several components of basal immunity and effector-triggered immunity of the japonica and indica rice varieties are associated with specialization of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. These differences thus play a key role in determining <italic>M. oryzae</italic> host specificity and may limit the spread of the pathogen within the Yuanyang agro-system. Specifically, the AVR-Pia effector has been identified as a possible determinant of the specialization of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> to local japonica rice.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19377"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19377"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19377","entryfile":"elife-19377-v1.xml","files":["elife-19377-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19377-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
