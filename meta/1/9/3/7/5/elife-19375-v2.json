MG mediates the glycation of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have recently demonstrated that MG-induced AGEs are a common feature of breast cancer. Little is known regarding the impact of MG-mediated carbonyl stress on tumor progression. Breast tumors with MG stress presented with high nuclear YAP, a key transcriptional co-activator regulating tumor growth and invasion. Elevated MG levels resulted in sustained YAP nuclear localization/activity that could be reverted using Carnosine, a scavenger for MG. MG treatment affected Hsp90 chaperone activity and decreased its binding to LATS1, a key kinase of the Hippo pathway. Cancer cells with high MG stress showed enhanced growth and metastatic potential in vivo. These findings reinforce the cumulative evidence pointing to hyperglycemia as a risk factor for cancer incidence and bring renewed interest in MG scavengers for cancer treatment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19375"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19375"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19375","entryfile":"elife-19375-v2.xml","files":["elife-19375-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19375-v1.xml"]}
