{"title":"Phenotypic plasticity as an adaptation to a functional trade-off","author":[{"surname":"Yi","given-names":"Xiao"},{"surname":"Dean","given-names":"Antony M"}],"abstract":"We report the evolution of a phenotypically plastic behavior that circumvents the hardwired trade-off that exists when resources are partitioned between growth and motility in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We propagated cultures in a cyclical environment, alternating between growth up to carrying capacity and selection for chemotaxis. Initial adaptations boosted overall swimming speed at the expense of growth. The effect of the trade-off was subsequently eased through a change in behavior; while individual cells reduced motility during exponential growth, the faction of the population that was motile increased as the carrying capacity was approached. This plastic behavior was produced by a single amino acid replacement in FliA, a regulatory protein central to the chemotaxis network. Our results illustrate how phenotypic plasticity potentiates evolvability by opening up new regions of the adaptive landscape.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19307"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19307"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19307","entryfile":"elife-19307-v3.xml","files":["elife-19307-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-figsupp7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19307-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19307-v1.xml","elife-19307-v2.xml"]}
