Combining electron microscopy, genetics, transcriptome profiling, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we discovered a peptidergic neuron that modulates <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor circuit dynamics. The Six/SO-family homeobox transcription factor UNC-39 governs lineage-specific neurogenesis to give rise to a neuron RID. RID bears the anatomic hallmarks of a specialized endocrine neuron: it harbors near-exclusive dense core vesicles that cluster periodically along the axon, and expresses multiple neuropeptides, including the FMRF-amide-related FLP-14. RID activity increases during forward movement. Ablating RID reduces the sustainability of forward movement, a phenotype partially recapitulated by removing FLP-14. Optogenetic depolarization of RID prolongs forward movement, an effect reduced in the absence of FLP-14. Together, these results establish the role of a neuroendocrine cell RID in sustaining a specific behavioral state in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19887"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19887"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19887","entryfile":"elife-19887-v4.xml","files":["elife-19887-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig7-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig8-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19887-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-19887-v1.xml","elife-19887-v2.xml","elife-19887-v3.xml"]}
