Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bax</italic> in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that <italic>Bax</italic> deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19886"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19886"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19886","entryfile":"elife-19886-v1.xml","files":["elife-19886-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19886-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
