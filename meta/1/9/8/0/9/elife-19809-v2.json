Elevated levels of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) appear to drive neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease (PD); neuronal accumulation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); and their increased levels cause neurodegeneration in humans and model organisms. Despite the clinical differences between AD and PD, several lines of evidence suggest that α-Syn and tau overlap pathologically. The connections between α-Syn and tau led us to ask whether these proteins might be regulated through a shared pathway. We therefore screened for genes that affect post-translational levels of α-Syn and tau. We found that TRIM28 regulates α-Syn and tau levels and that its reduction rescues toxicity in animal models of tau- and α-Syn-mediated degeneration. TRIM28 stabilizes and promotes the nuclear accumulation and toxicity of both proteins. Intersecting screens across comorbid proteinopathies thus reveal shared mechanisms and therapeutic entry points.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19809"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19809"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19809","entryfile":"elife-19809-v2.xml","files":["elife-19809-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19809-v1.xml"]}
