Derived primarily from the liver, it inhibits the iron exporter ferroportin in the gut and spleen, the sites of iron absorption and recycling respectively. Recently, we demonstrated that ferroportin is also found in cardiomyocytes, and that its cardiac-specific deletion leads to fatal cardiac iron overload. Hepcidin is also expressed in cardiomyocytes, where its function remains unknown. To define the function of cardiomyocyte hepcidin, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of hepcidin, or knock-in of hepcidin-resistant ferroportin. We find that while both models maintain normal systemic iron homeostasis, they nonetheless develop fatal contractile and metabolic dysfunction as a consequence of cardiomyocyte iron deficiency. These findings are the first demonstration of a cell-autonomous role for hepcidin in iron homeostasis. They raise the possibility that such function may also be important in other tissues that express both hepcidin and ferroportin, such as the kidney and the brain.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19804"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19804"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19804","entryfile":"elife-19804-v2.xml","files":["elife-19804-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-app1-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-app1-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-app1-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-app1-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-app1-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19804-v1.xml"]}
