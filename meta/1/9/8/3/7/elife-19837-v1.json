In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, stress-induced sleep(SIS) is regulated by cytokine activation of the ALA neuron, which releases FLP-13 neuropeptides characterized by an amidated arginine-phenylalanine (RFamide) C-terminus motif. By performing an unbiased genetic screen for mutants that impair the somnogenic effects of FLP-13 neuropeptides, we identified the gene <italic>dmsr-1</italic>, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor similar to an insect RFamide receptor. DMSR-1 is activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell culture, is required for SIS <italic>in vivo</italic>, is expressed non-synaptically in several wake-promoting neurons, and likely couples to a Gi/o heterotrimeric G-protein. Our data expand our understanding of how a single neuroendocrine cell coordinates an organism-wide behavioral response, and suggest that similar signaling principles may function in other organisms to regulate sleep during sickness.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19837"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19837"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19837","entryfile":"elife-19837-v1.xml","files":["elife-19837-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19837-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
