{"title":"Transcription leads to pervasive replisome instability in bacteria","author":[{"surname":"Mangiameli","given-names":"Sarah M"},{"surname":"Merrikh","given-names":"Christopher N"},{"surname":"Wiggins","given-names":"Paul A"},{"surname":"Merrikh","given-names":"Houra"}],"abstract":"The canonical model of DNA replication describes a highly-processive and largely continuous process by which the genome is duplicated. This continuous model is based upon <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution and <italic>in vivo</italic> ensemble experiments. Here, we characterize the replisome-complex stoichiometry and dynamics with single-molecule resolution in bacterial cells. Strikingly, the stoichiometries of the replicative helicase, DNA polymerase, and clamp loader complexes are consistent with the presence of only one active replisome in a significant fraction of cells (>40%). Furthermore, many of the observed complexes have short lifetimes (<8 min), suggesting that replisome disassembly is quite prevalent, possibly occurring several times per cell cycle. The instability of the replisome complex is conflict-induced: transcription inhibition stabilizes these complexes, restoring the second replisome in many of the cells. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the canonical model, DNA replication is a largely discontinuous process <italic>in vivo</italic> due to pervasive replication-transcription conflicts.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19848"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19848"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19848","entryfile":"elife-19848-v3.xml","files":["elife-19848-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19848-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19848-v1.xml","elife-19848-v2.xml"]}
