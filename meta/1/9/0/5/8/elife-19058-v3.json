Sdks mediate cell-cell adhesion with homophilic specificity that underlies their neuronal targeting function. Here we report crystal structures of Sdk1 and Sdk2 ectodomain regions, revealing similar homodimers mediated by the four N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (Ig1–4), arranged in a horseshoe conformation. These Ig1–4 horseshoes interact in a novel back-to-back orientation in both homodimers through Ig1:Ig2, Ig1:Ig1 and Ig3:Ig4 interactions. Structure-guided mutagenesis results show that this canonical dimer is required for both Sdk-mediated cell aggregation (via <italic>trans</italic> interactions) and Sdk clustering in isolated cells (via <italic>cis</italic> interactions). Sdk1/Sdk2 recognition specificity is encoded across Ig1–4, with Ig1–2 conferring the majority of binding affinity and differential specificity. We suggest that competition between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions provides a novel mechanism to sharpen the specificity of cell-cell interactions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19058"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19058"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19058","entryfile":"elife-19058-v3.xml","files":["elife-19058-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19058-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19058-v1.xml","elife-19058-v2.xml"]}
