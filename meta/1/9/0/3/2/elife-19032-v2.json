One proposed gain-of-function mechanism is that repeat-containing RNA forms aggregates that sequester RNA binding proteins, leading to altered RNA metabolism in motor neurons. Here, we identify the zinc finger protein Zfp106 as a specific GGGGCC RNA repeat-binding protein, and using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that Zfp106 interacts with multiple other RNA binding proteins, including the ALS-associated factors TDP-43 and FUS. We also show that <italic>Zfp106</italic> knockout mice develop severe motor neuron degeneration, which can be suppressed by transgenic restoration of Zfp106 specifically in motor neurons. Finally, we show that Zfp106 potently suppresses neurotoxicity in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of <italic>C9orf72</italic> ALS. Thus, these studies identify Zfp106 as an RNA binding protein with important implications for ALS.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19032"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19032"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19032","entryfile":"elife-19032-v2.xml","files":["elife-19032-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19032-v1.xml"]}
