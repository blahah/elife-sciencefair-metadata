We have discovered that human cell lines in culture proliferate with intact chromosomal origins of replication after disruption of both alleles of <italic>ORC2</italic> or of the ATPase subunit, <italic>ORC1</italic>. The <italic>ORC1</italic> or <italic>ORC2</italic>-depleted cells replicate with decreased chromatin loading of MCM2-7 and become critically dependent on another ATPase, CDC6, for survival and DNA replication. Thus, either the ORC ring lacking a subunit, even its ATPase subunit, can load enough MCM2-7 in partnership with CDC6 to initiate DNA replication, or cells have an ORC-independent, CDC6-dependent mechanism to load MCM2-7 on origins of replication","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19084"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19084"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19084","entryfile":"elife-19084-v2.xml","files":["elife-19084-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19084-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19084-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19084-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19084-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19084-v1.xml"]}
