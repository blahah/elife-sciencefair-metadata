A central element of this process are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> are produced by a specialized RNA polymerase known as Pol V. Here we show that non-coding transcription by Pol V is controlled by preexisting chromatin modifications located within the transcribed regions. Most Pol V transcripts are associated with AGO4 but are not sliced by AGO4. Pol V-dependent DNA methylation is established on both strands of DNA and is tightly restricted to Pol V-transcribed regions. This indicates that chromatin modifications are established in close proximity to Pol V. Finally, Pol V transcription is preferentially enriched on edges of silenced transposable elements, where Pol V transcribes into TEs. We propose that Pol V may play an important role in the determination of heterochromatin boundaries.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19092"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19092"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19092","entryfile":"elife-19092-v1.xml","files":["elife-19092-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19092-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
