However, mispairing of the therapeutic αβ chains with endogenous αβ chains reduces therapeutic TCR surface expression and generates self-reactive TCRs. We report a general strategy to prevent TCR mispairing: swapping constant domains between the α and β chains of a therapeutic TCR. When paired, domain-swapped (ds)TCRs assemble with CD3, express on the cell surface, and mediate antigen-specific T cell responses. By contrast, dsTCR chains mispaired with endogenous chains cannot properly assemble with CD3 or signal, preventing autoimmunity. We validate this approach in cell-based assays and in a mouse model of TCR gene transfer-induced graft-versus-host disease. We also validate a related approach whereby replacement of αβ TCR domains with corresponding γδ TCR domains yields a functional TCR that does not mispair. This work enables the design of safer TCR gene therapies for cancer immunotherapy.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19095"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19095"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19095","entryfile":"elife-19095-v1.xml","files":["elife-19095-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19095-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
