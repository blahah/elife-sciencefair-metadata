Unusual 3→3 cross-links formed by L,D-transpeptidases were first detected in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> more than four decades ago, however no phenotype has previously been associated with their synthesis. Here we show that production of the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB in combination with elevated synthesis of the (p)ppGpp alarmone by RelA lead to full bypass of the D,D-transpeptidase activity of PBPs and to broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance. Production of YcbB was therefore sufficient to switch the role of (p)ppGpp from antibiotic tolerance to high-level β-lactam resistance. This observation identifies a new mode of peptidoglycan polymerization in <italic>E. coli</italic> that relies on an unexpectedly small number of enzyme activities comprising the glycosyltransferase activity of class A PBP1b and the D,D-carboxypeptidase activity of DacA in addition to the L,D-transpeptidase activity of YcbB.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19469"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19469"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"19469","entryfile":"elife-19469-v2.xml","files":["elife-19469-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19469-v1.xml"]}
