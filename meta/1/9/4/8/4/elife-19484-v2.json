{"title":"Smad4 restricts differentiation to promote expansion of satellite cell derived progenitors during skeletal muscle regeneration","author":[{"surname":"Paris","given-names":"Nicole D"},{"surname":"Soroka","given-names":"Andrew"},{"surname":"Klose","given-names":"Alanna"},{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Wenxuan"},{"surname":"Chakkalakal","given-names":"Joe V"}],"abstract":"Skeletal muscle regenerative potential declines with age, in part due to deficiencies in resident stem cells (satellite cells, SCs) and derived myogenic progenitors (MPs); however, the factors responsible for this decline remain obscure. TGFβ superfamily signaling is an inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, with elevated activity in aged skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, we find reduced expression of <italic>Smad4</italic>, the downstream cofactor for canonical TGFβ superfamily signaling, and the target <italic>Id1</italic> in aged SCs and MPs during regeneration. Specific deletion of Smad4 in adult mouse SCs led to increased propensity for terminal myogenic commitment connected to impaired proliferative potential. Furthermore, SC-specific Smad4 disruption compromised adult skeletal muscle regeneration. Finally, loss of Smad4 in aged SCs did not promote aged skeletal muscle regeneration. Therefore, SC-specific reduction of Smad4 is a feature of aged regenerating skeletal muscle and Smad4 is a critical regulator of SC and MP amplification during skeletal muscle regeneration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19484"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19484"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19484","entryfile":"elife-19484-v2.xml","files":["elife-19484-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19484-v1.xml"]}
