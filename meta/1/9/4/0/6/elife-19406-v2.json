The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (<italic>DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C</italic>, <italic>CAMKV</italic>) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19406"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19406"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19406","entryfile":"elife-19406-v2.xml","files":["elife-19406-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19406-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19406-v1.xml"]}
