Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19430"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19430"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19430","entryfile":"elife-19430-v1.xml","files":["elife-19430-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19430-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
