{"title":"CPEB4 is regulated during cell cycle by ERK2/Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation and its assembly into liquid-like droplets","author":[{"surname":"Guillén-Boixet","given-names":"Jordina"},{"surname":"Buzon","given-names":"Víctor"},{"surname":"Salvatella","given-names":"Xavier"},{"surname":"Méndez","given-names":"Raúl"}],"abstract":"The four members of the vertebrate CPEB family of RNA-binding proteins share similar RNA-binding domains by which they regulate the translation of CPE-containing mRNAs, thereby controlling cell cycle and differentiation or synaptic plasticity. However, the N-terminal domains of CPEBs are distinct and contain specific regulatory post-translational modifications that presumably differentially integrate extracellular signals. Here we show that CPEB4 activity is regulated by ERK2- and Cdk1-mediated hyperphosphorylation. These phosphorylation events additively activate CPEB4 in M-phase by maintaining it in its monomeric state. In contrast, unphosphorylated CPEB4 phase separates into inactive, liquid-like droplets through its intrinsically disordered regions in the N-terminal domain. This dynamic and reversible regulation of CPEB4 is coordinated with that of CPEB1 through Cdk1, which inactivates CPEB1 while activating CPEB4, thereby integrating phase-specific signal transduction pathways to regulate cell cycle progression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19298"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19298"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19298","entryfile":"elife-19298-v2.xml","files":["elife-19298-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19298-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19298-v1.xml"]}
