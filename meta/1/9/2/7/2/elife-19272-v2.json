Guided by protein dimerization properties, we examined DNA binding specificities of 270 human bZIP pairs. DNA interactomes of 80 heterodimers and 22 homodimers revealed that 72% of heterodimer motifs correspond to conjoined half-sites preferred by partnering monomers. Remarkably, the remaining motifs are composed of variably-spaced half-sites (12%) or ‘emergent’ sites (16%) that cannot be readily inferred from half-site preferences of partnering monomers. These binding sites were biochemically validated by EMSA-FRET analysis and validated in vivo by ChIP-seq data from human cell lines. Focusing on ATF3, we observed distinct cognate site preferences conferred by different bZIP partners, and demonstrated that genome-wide binding of ATF3 is best explained by considering many dimers in which it participates. Importantly, our compendium of bZIP-DNA interactomes predicted bZIP binding to 156 disease associated SNPs, of which only 20 were previously annotated with known bZIP motifs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19272"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19272"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19272","entryfile":"elife-19272-v2.xml","files":["elife-19272-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19272-v1.xml"]}
