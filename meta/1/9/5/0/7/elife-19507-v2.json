The neural dynamics in the striatum have been described in tasks with short delay periods (1â€“4 s), but remain largely uncharacterized for tasks with longer delay periods. We collected and analyzed single unit recordings from the dorsomedial striatum of rats performing a spatial working memory task with delays up to 10 s. We found that neurons were activated sequentially, with the sequences spanning the entire delay period. Surprisingly, this sequential activity was dissociated from stimulus encoding activity, which was present in the same neurons, but preferentially appeared towards the onset of the delay period. These observations contrast with descriptions of sequential dynamics during similar tasks in other brains areas, and clarify the contribution of the striatum to spatial working memory.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19507"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19507"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19507","entryfile":"elife-19507-v2.xml","files":["elife-19507-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19507-v1.xml"]}
