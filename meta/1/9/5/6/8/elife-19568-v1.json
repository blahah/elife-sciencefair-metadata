Here, we report hominin tracks unearthed in the new Site S at Laetoli and referred to two bipedal individuals (S1 and S2) moving on the same palaeosurface and in the same direction as the three hominins documented at Site G. The stature estimates for S1 greatly exceed those previously reconstructed for <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> from both skeletal material and footprint data. In combination with a comparative reappraisal of the Site G footprints, the evidence collected here embodies very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behaviour and morphology. Our results are consistent with considerable body size variation and, probably, degree of sexual dimorphism within a single species of bipedal hominins as early as 3.66 million years ago.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19568"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19568"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19568","entryfile":"elife-19568-v1.xml","files":["elife-19568-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig11-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19568-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
