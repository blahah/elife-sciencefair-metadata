{"title":"A long-term epigenetic memory switch controls bacterial virulence bimodality","author":[{"surname":"Ronin","given-names":"Irine"},{"surname":"Katsowich","given-names":"Naama"},{"surname":"Rosenshine","given-names":"Ilan"},{"surname":"Balaban","given-names":"Nathalie Q"}],"abstract":"When pathogens enter the host, sensing of environmental cues activates the expression of virulence genes. Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability in enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. We identified the <italic>per</italic> operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host spreading.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19599"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19599"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19599","entryfile":"elife-19599-v2.xml","files":["elife-19599-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19599-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19599-v1.xml"]}
