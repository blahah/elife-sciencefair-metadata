Sin1 is one of the TORC2-specific subunit essential for phosphorylation and activation of certain AGC-family kinases. Here, we show that Sin1 is dispensable for the catalytic activity of TORC2, but its conserved region in the middle (Sin1CRIM) forms a discrete domain that specifically binds the TORC2 substrate kinases. Sin1CRIM fused to a different TORC2 subunit can recruit the TORC2 substrate Gad8 for phosphorylation even in the <italic>sin1</italic> null mutant of fission yeast. The solution structure of Sin1CRIM shows a ubiquitin-like fold with a characteristic acidic loop, which is essential for interaction with the TORC2 substrates. The specific substrate-recognition function is conserved in human Sin1CRIM, which may represent a potential target for novel anticancer drugs that prevent activation of the mTORC2 substrates such as AKT.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19594"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19594"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19594","entryfile":"elife-19594-v1.xml","files":["elife-19594-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19594-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
