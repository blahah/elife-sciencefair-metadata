{"title":"Controlling contractile instabilities in the actomyosin cortex","author":[{"surname":"Nishikawa","given-names":"Masatoshi"},{"surname":"Naganathan","given-names":"Sundar Ram"},{"surname":"JÃ¼licher","given-names":"Frank"},{"surname":"Grill","given-names":"Stephan W"}],"abstract":"The actomyosin cell cortex is an active contractile material for driving cell- and tissue morphogenesis. The cortex has a tendency to form a pattern of myosin foci, which is a signature of potentially unstable behavior. How a system that is prone to such instabilities can rveliably drive morphogenesis remains an outstanding question. Here, we report that in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> zygote, feedback between active RhoA and myosin induces a contractile instability in the cortex. We discover that an independent RhoA pacemaking oscillator controls this instability, generating a pulsatory pattern of myosin foci and preventing the collapse of cortical material into a few dynamic contracting regions. Our work reveals how contractile instabilities that are natural to occur in mechanically active media can be biochemically controlled to robustly drive morphogenetic events.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19595"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19595"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19595","entryfile":"elife-19595-v3.xml","files":["elife-19595-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19595-v1.xml","elife-19595-v2.xml"]}
