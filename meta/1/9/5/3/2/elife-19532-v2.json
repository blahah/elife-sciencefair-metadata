The system closely follows murine ethology. It requires no contact between a human experimenter and tested animals, overcoming the confounding factors that lead to irreproducible assessment of murine social behavior between laboratories. In Eco-HAB, group-housed animals live in a spacious, four-compartment apparatus with shadowed areas and narrow tunnels, resembling natural burrows. Eco-HAB allows for assessment of the tendency of mice to voluntarily spend time together in ethologically relevant mouse group sizes. Custom-made software for automated tracking, data extraction, and analysis enables quick evaluation of social impairments. The developed protocols and standardized behavioral measures demonstrate high replicability. Unlike classic three-chambered sociability tests, Eco-HAB provides measurements of spontaneous, ecologically relevant social behaviors in group-housed animals. Results are obtained faster, with less manpower, and without confounding factors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19532"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19532"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19532","entryfile":"elife-19532-v2.xml","files":["elife-19532-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19532-v1.xml"]}
