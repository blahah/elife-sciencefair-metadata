Such induced defenses are often mediated by early defense signaling (EDS) rapidly activated by the perception of herbivore associated elicitors (HAE) that includes transient accumulations of jasmonic acid (JA). Analyzing 60 HAE-induced leaf transcriptomes from closely-related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species revealed a key gene co-expression network (M4 module) which is co-activated with the HAE-induced JA accumulations but is elicited independently of JA, as revealed in plants silenced in JA signaling. Functional annotations of the M4 module were consistent with roles in EDS and a newly identified hub gene of the M4 module (NaLRRK1) mediates a negative feedback loop with JA signaling. Phylogenomic analysis revealed preferential gene retention after genome-wide duplications shaped the evolution of HAE-induced EDS in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>. These results highlight the importance of genome-wide duplications in the evolution of adaptive traits in plants.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19531"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19531"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19531","entryfile":"elife-19531-v2.xml","files":["elife-19531-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19531-v1.xml"]}
