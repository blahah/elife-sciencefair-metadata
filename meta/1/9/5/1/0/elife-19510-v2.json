Here, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> GLR glial cells regulate axon specification of their nearby GABAergic RME neurons through GLR-RME gap junctions. Disruption of GLR-RME gap junctions causes misaccumulation of axonal markers in non-axonal neurites of RME neurons and converts microtubules in those neurites to form an axon-like assembly. We further uncover that GLR-RME gap junctions regulate RME axon specification through activation of the CDK-5 pathway in a calcium-dependent manner, involving a calpain <italic>clp-4</italic>. Therefore, our study reveals the function of glia-neuron gap junctions in neuronal axon specification and shows that calcium originated from glial cells can regulate neuronal intracellular pathways through gap junctions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19510"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19510"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"19510","entryfile":"elife-19510-v2.xml","files":["elife-19510-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19510-v1.xml"]}
