In vivo, wide-field GCaMP imaging and sub-cortical/cortical cellular electrophysiology were used in mice to investigate relationships between spontaneous single neuron spiking and mesoscopic cortical activity. We make use of a rich set of cortical activity motifs that are present in spontaneous activity in anesthetized and awake animals. A mesoscale spike-triggered averaging procedure allowed the identification of motifs that are preferentially linked to individual spiking neurons by employing genetically targeted indicators of neuronal activity. Thalamic neurons predicted and reported specific cycles of wide-scale cortical inhibition/excitation. In contrast, spike-triggered maps derived from single cortical neurons yielded spatio-temporal maps expected for regional cortical consensus function. This approach can define network relationships between any point source of neuronal spiking and mesoscale cortical maps.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19976"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19976"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19976","entryfile":"elife-19976-v2.xml","files":["elife-19976-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig6-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig6-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19976-v1.xml"]}
