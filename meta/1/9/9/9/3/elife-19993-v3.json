We report an ancient family of GCNA (germ cell nuclear antigen) proteins that arose in the earliest eukaryotes, and feature a rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that GCNA proteins emerged before the major eukaryotic lineages diverged; GCNA predates the origin of a dedicated germline by a billion years. <italic>Gcna</italic> gene expression is enriched in reproductive cells across eukarya â€“ either just prior to or during meiosis in single-celled eukaryotes, and in stem cells and germ cells of diverse multicellular animals. Studies of <italic>Gcna-</italic>mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mice indicate that GCNA has functioned in reproduction for at least 600 million years. Homology to IDR-containing proteins implicated in DNA damage repair suggests that GCNA proteins may protect the genomic integrity of cells carrying a heritable genome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19993"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19993"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19993","entryfile":"elife-19993-v3.xml","files":["elife-19993-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-19993-v1.xml","elife-19993-v2.xml"]}
