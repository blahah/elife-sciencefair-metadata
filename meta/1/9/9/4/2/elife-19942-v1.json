Here we stimulated fly neurons with different paradigms and identified ARGs using high-throughput sequencing from brains as well as from sorted neurons: they included a narrow set of circadian neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons. Surprisingly, many ARGs are specific to the stimulation paradigm and very specific to neuron type. In addition and unlike mammalian immediate early genes (IEGs), fly ARGs do not have short gene lengths and are less enriched for transcription factor function. Chromatin assays using ATAC-sequencing show that the transcription start sites (TSS) of ARGs do not change with neural firing but are already accessible prior to stimulation. Lastly based on binding site enrichment in ARGs, we identified transcription factor mediators of firing and created neuronal activity reporters.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19942"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19942"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19942","entryfile":"elife-19942-v1.xml","files":["elife-19942-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19942-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
