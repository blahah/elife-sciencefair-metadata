We have employed cysteine labelling and linkage analysis to the full length of Bak in mitochondria. This comprehensive survey showed that in each Bak dimer the N-termini are fully solvent-exposed and mobile, the core is highly structured, and the C-termini are flexible but restrained by their contact with the membrane. Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement. Together, our data show that Bak dimers form disordered clusters to generate lipidic pores. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the observed structural heterogeneity of the apoptotic pore.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19944"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19944"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19944","entryfile":"elife-19944-v1.xml","files":["elife-19944-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-19944-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
