Tom1 directly ubiquitinates unassembled RPs primarily via residues that are concealed in mature ribosomes. Together, these data point to an important role for Tom1 in normal physiology and prompt us to refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for excess ribosomal protein quality control. A similar pathway, mediated by the Tom1 homolog Huwe1, restricts accumulation of overexpressed hRpl26 in human cells. We propose that ERISQ is a key element of the quality control machinery that sustains protein homeostasis and cellular fitness in eukaryotes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19105"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19105"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19105","entryfile":"elife-19105-v2.xml","files":["elife-19105-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-19105-v1.xml"]}
