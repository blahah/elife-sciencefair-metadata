To adjust the X gene dosage between genders, female mouse preimplantation embryos undergo an imprinted form of X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) that requires both <italic>Rlim</italic> (also known as Rnf12) and the long non-coding RNA <italic>Xist</italic>. Moreover, it is thought that gene expression from the single active X is upregulated to correct for bi-allelic autosomal (A) gene expression. We have combined mouse genetics with RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to investigate functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> on the temporal regulation of iXCI and <italic>Xist</italic>. Our results reveal crucial roles of <italic>Rlim</italic> for the maintenance of high <italic>Xist</italic> RNA levels, <italic>Xist</italic> clouds and X-silencing in female embryos at blastocyst stages, while initial <italic>Xist</italic> expression appears <italic>Rlim</italic>-independent. We find further that X/A upregulation is initiated in early male and female preimplantation embryos.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"19127"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.19127"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"19127","entryfile":"elife-19127-v5.xml","files":["elife-19127-fig1-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig2-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig2-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig3-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig3-figsupp2-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig3-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig4-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig5-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig5-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig6-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-fig6-v5-600w.jpg","elife-19127-v1.xml","elife-19127-v2.xml","elife-19127-v3.xml","elife-19127-v4.xml"]}
