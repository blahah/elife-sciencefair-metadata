{"title":"Continuous lateral oscillations as a core mechanism for taxis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae","author":[{"surname":"Wystrach","given-names":"Antoine"},{"surname":"Lagogiannis","given-names":"Konstantinos"},{"surname":"Webb","given-names":"Barbara"}],"abstract":"Taxis behaviour in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is thought to consist of distinct control mechanisms triggering specific actions. Here, we support a simpler hypothesis: that taxis results from direct sensory modulation of continuous lateral oscillations of the anterior body, sparing the need for ‘action selection’. Our analysis of larvae motion reveals a rhythmic, continuous lateral oscillation of the anterior body, encompassing all head-sweeps, small or large, without breaking the oscillatory rhythm. Further, we show that an agent-model that embeds this hypothesis reproduces a surprising number of taxis signatures observed in larvae. Also, by coupling the sensory input to a neural oscillator in continuous time, we show that the mechanism is robust and biologically plausible. The mechanism provides a simple architecture for combining information across modalities, and explaining how learnt associations modulate taxis. We discuss the results in the light of larval neural circuitry and make testable predictions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15504"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15504"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15504","entryfile":"elife-15504-v2.xml","files":["elife-15504-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15504-v1.xml"]}
