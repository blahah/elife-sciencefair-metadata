Previously, we determined X-ray crystal structures of ESCRT-III subunit Snf7, the yeast CHMP4 ortholog, in its active and polymeric state (<xref>Tang et al., 2015</xref>). However, how ESCRT-III activation is coordinated by the upstream ESCRT components at endosomes remains unclear. Here, we provide a molecular explanation for the functional divergence of structurally similar ESCRT-III subunits. We characterize novel mutations in ESCRT-III Snf7 that trigger activation, and identify a novel role of Bro1, the yeast ALIX ortholog, in Snf7 assembly. We show that upstream ESCRTs regulate Snf7 activation at both its N-terminal core domain and the C-terminus Î±6 helix through two parallel ubiquitin-dependent pathways: the ESCRT-I-ESCRT-II-Vps20 pathway and the ESCRT-0-Bro1 pathway. We therefore provide an enhanced understanding for the activation of the spatially unique ESCRT-III-mediated membrane remodeling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15507"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15507"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"15507","entryfile":"elife-15507-v2.xml","files":["elife-15507-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15507-v1.xml"]}
