The uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pore formed by the MCU protein and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation mediated by MICU subunits. Recently, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein EMRE was identified as a uniporter subunit absolutely required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory purpose of EMRE remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine the transmembrane orientation of EMRE, and show that its known MCU-activating function is mediated by the interaction of transmembrane helices from both proteins. We also reveal a second function of EMRE: to maintain tight MICU regulation of the MCU pore, a role that requires EMRE to bind MICU1 using its conserved C-terminal polyaspartate tail. This dual functionality of EMRE ensures that all transport-competent uniporters are tightly regulated, responding appropriately to a dynamic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> landscape.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15545"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15545"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15545","entryfile":"elife-15545-v5.xml","files":["elife-15545-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig2-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig2-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig3-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig3-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp2-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-figsupp3-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig4-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig5-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig5-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig6-figsupp1-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig6-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-15545-fig7-v5-600w.jpg","elife-15545-v1.xml","elife-15545-v2.xml","elife-15545-v3.xml","elife-15545-v4.xml"]}
