It is composed of glucose polymers that form massive semi-crystalline granules. Its precise structure and composition determine its functionality and thus applications; however, there is no versatile model system allowing the relationships between the biosynthetic apparatus, glucan structure and properties to be explored. Here, we expressed the core Arabidopsis starch-biosynthesis pathway in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> purged of its endogenous glycogen-metabolic enzymes. Systematic variation of the set of biosynthetic enzymes illustrated how each affects glucan structure and solubility. Expression of the complete set resulted in dense, insoluble granules with a starch-like semi-crystalline organization, demonstrating that this system indeed simulates starch biosynthesis. Thus, the yeast system has the potential to accelerate starch research and help create a holistic understanding of starch granule biosynthesis, providing a basis for the targeted biotechnological improvement of crops.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15552"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15552"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15552","entryfile":"elife-15552-v1.xml","files":["elife-15552-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15552-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
