The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1–3) bind to m<sup>6</sup>A-modified cellular RNAs and affect RNA metabolism and processing. Here, we show that YTHDF1–3 proteins recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified HIV-1 RNA and inhibit HIV-1 infection in cell lines and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. We further mapped the YTHDF1–3 binding sites in HIV-1 RNA from infected cells. We found that the overexpression of YTHDF proteins in cells inhibited HIV-1 infection mainly by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription, while knockdown of YTHDF1–3 in cells had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A writers decreased HIV-1 Gag protein expression in virus-producing cells, while silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A erasers increased Gag expression. Our findings suggest an important role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA in viral infection and HIV-1 protein synthesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15528"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15528"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15528","entryfile":"elife-15528-v3.xml","files":["elife-15528-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15528-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15528-v1.xml","elife-15528-v2.xml"]}
