{"title":"The GIRK1 subunit potentiates G protein activation of cardiac GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers","author":[{"surname":"Touhara","given-names":"Kouki K"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Weiwei"},{"surname":"MacKinnon","given-names":"Roderick"}],"abstract":"G protein gated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels are gated by direct binding of G protein beta-gamma subunits (Gβγ), signaling lipids, and intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. In cardiac pacemaker cells, hetero-tetramer GIRK1/4 channels and homo-tetramer GIRK4 channels play a central role in parasympathetic slowing of heart rate. It is known that the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site of the GIRK1 subunit is defective, but the functional difference between GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers remains unclear. Here, using purified proteins and the lipid bilayer system, we characterize Gβγ and Na<sup>+</sup> regulation of GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers. We find in GIRK4 homo-tetramers that Na<sup>+</sup> binding increases Gβγ affinity and thereby increases the GIRK4 responsiveness to G protein stimulation. GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers are not activated by Na<sup>+</sup>, but rather are in a permanent state of high responsiveness to Gβγ, suggesting that the GIRK1 subunit functions like a GIRK4 subunit with Na<sup>+</sup> permanently bound.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15750"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15750"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15750","entryfile":"elife-15750-v2.xml","files":["elife-15750-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15750-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15750-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15750-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15750-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15750-v1.xml"]}
