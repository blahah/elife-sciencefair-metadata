Here we describe an assay to measure neuronal GIRK2 activity as a function of membrane-anchored G protein concentration. Using this assay we show that four Gβγ subunits bind cooperatively to open GIRK2, and that intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> – which enters neurons during action potentials – further amplifies opening mostly by increasing Gβγ affinity. A Na<sup>+</sup> amplification function is characterized and used to estimate the concentration of Gβγ subunits that appear in the membrane of mouse dopamine neurons when GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are stimulated. We conclude that GIRK2, through its dual responsiveness to Gβγ and Na<sup>+</sup>, mediates a form of neuronal inhibition that is amplifiable in the setting of excess electrical activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15751"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15751"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15751","entryfile":"elife-15751-v2.xml","files":["elife-15751-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15751-v1.xml"]}
