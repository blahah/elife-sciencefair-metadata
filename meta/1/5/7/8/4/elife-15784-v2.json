Accordingly, the myelin observed in neocortical gray matter is thought to mostly ensheath excitatory axons connecting to subcortical regions and distant cortical areas. Using independent analyses of light and electron microscopy data from mouse neocortex, we show that a surprisingly large fraction of cortical myelin (half the myelin in layer 2/3 and a quarter in layer 4) ensheathes axons of inhibitory neurons, specifically of parvalbumin-positive basket cells. This myelin differs significantly from that of excitatory axons in distribution and protein composition. Myelin on inhibitory axons is unlikely to meaningfully hasten the arrival of spikes at their pre-synaptic terminals, due to the patchy distribution and short path-lengths observed. Our results thus highlight the need for exploring alternative roles for myelin in neocortical circuits.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15784"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15784"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15784","entryfile":"elife-15784-v2.xml","files":["elife-15784-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15784-v1.xml"]}
