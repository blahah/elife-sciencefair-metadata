{"title":"Community-level cohesion without cooperation","author":[{"surname":"Tikhonov","given-names":"Mikhail"}],"abstract":"Recent work draws attention to community-community encounters ('coalescence') as likely an important factor shaping natural ecosystems. This work builds on MacArthurâ€™s classic model of competitive coexistence to investigate such community-level competition in a minimal theoretical setting. It is shown that the ability of a species to survive a coalescence event is best predicted by a community-level 'fitness' of its native community rather than the intrinsic performance of the species itself. The model presented here allows formalizing a macroscopic perspective whereby a community harboring organisms at varying abundances becomes equivalent to a single organism expressing genes at different levels. While most natural communities do not satisfy the strict criteria of multicellularity developed by multi-level selection theory, the effective cohesion described here is a generic consequence of resource partitioning, requires no cooperative interactions, and can be expected to be widespread in microbial ecosystems.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15747"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15747"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15747","entryfile":"elife-15747-v2.xml","files":["elife-15747-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15747-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15747-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15747-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15747-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15747-v1.xml"]}
