As is the case for all voltage-gated channels, it is widely assumed that individual Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels behave independently with respect to voltage-activation, open probability, and facilitation. Here, we report the results of super-resolution imaging, optogenetic, and electrophysiological measurements that refute this long-held view. We found that the short channel isoform (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>), but not the long (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>), associates in functional clusters of two or more channels that open cooperatively, facilitating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels are coupled via a C-terminus-to-C-terminus interaction that requires binding of the incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and subsequent binding of CaM to the pre-IQ domain of the channels. Physically-coupled channels facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents as a consequence of their higher open probabilities, leading to increased firing rates in rat hippocampal neurons. We propose that cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels represents a mechanism for the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and electrical activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15744"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15744"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15744","entryfile":"elife-15744-v1.xml","files":["elife-15744-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15744-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
