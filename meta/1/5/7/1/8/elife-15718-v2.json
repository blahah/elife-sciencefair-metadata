Enteric bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to sense bile as an environmental cue to regulate virulence genes during infection. We discovered that <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> VtrC, along with VtrA and VtrB, are required for activating the virulence type III secretion system 2 in response to bile salts. The VtrA/VtrC complex activates VtrB in the presence of bile salts. The crystal structure of the periplasmic domains of the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer reveals a Î²-barrel with a hydrophobic inner chamber. A co-crystal structure of VtrA/VtrC with bile salt, along with biophysical and mutational analysis, demonstrates that the hydrophobic chamber binds bile salts and activates the virulence network. As part of a family of conserved signaling receptors, VtrA/VtrC provides structural and functional insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanism used by bacteria to sense their environment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15718"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15718"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15718","entryfile":"elife-15718-v2.xml","files":["elife-15718-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15718-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15718-v1.xml"]}
