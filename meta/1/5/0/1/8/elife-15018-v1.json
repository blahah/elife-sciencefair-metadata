Genotoxic agents trigger a 'nuclear-to-cytoplasmic' NF-κB activation signaling pathway; however, the early nuclear signaling cascade linking DNA damage and NF-κB activation is poorly understood. Here we report that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa/KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1 (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is a key NF-κB regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated signaling pathway. Sam68 deficiency abolishes DNA damage-stimulated polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) production and the PAR-dependent NF-κB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes. Sam68 deleted cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA damaging agents. Upregulated Sam68 coincides with elevated PAR production and NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic transcription in human and mouse colon cancer. Knockdown of Sam68 sensitizes human colon cancer cells to genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and genetic deletion of Sam68 dampens colon tumor burden in mice. Together our data reveal a novel function of Sam68 in the genotoxic stress-initiated nuclear signaling, which is crucial for colon tumorigenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15018"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15018"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15018","entryfile":"elife-15018-v1.xml","files":["elife-15018-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15018-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
