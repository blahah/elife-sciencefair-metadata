We took an unbiased approach based on in vivo clonal labeling and tracking of biliary epithelial cells in the three-dimensional landscape, in combination with mathematical simulation, to understand their mode of proliferation in a mouse liver injury model where the nascent biliary structure formed in a tissue-intrinsic manner. An apparent heterogeneity among biliary epithelial cells was observed: whereas most of the responders that entered the cell cycle upon injury exhibited a limited and tapering growth potential, a select population continued to proliferate, making a major contribution in sustaining the biliary expansion. Our study has highlighted a unique mode of epithelial tissue dynamics, which depends not on a hierarchical system driven by fixated stem cells, but rather, on a stochastically maintained progenitor population with persistent proliferative activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15034"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15034"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15034","entryfile":"elife-15034-v1.xml","files":["elife-15034-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15034-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
