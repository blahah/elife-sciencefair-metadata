Using inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 knockout (<italic>Itpr2</italic>) mice to specifically disturb somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes, we showed that developmental elimination of the ventral posteromedial nucleus relay synapse was impaired. Interestingly, intracerebroventricular injection of ATP, but not adenosine, rescued the deficit in synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2</italic> mice. Further studies showed that developmental synapse elimination was also impaired in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mice and was not rescued by ATP, indicating a possible role of purinergic signaling. This hypothesis was confirmed by MRS-2365, a selective P2Y1 agonist, could also rescue the deficient of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2</italic> mice. Our results uncovered a novel mechanism suggesting that astrocytes release ATP in an IP3R2-dependent manner to regulate synapse elimination.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15043"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15043"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15043","entryfile":"elife-15043-v1.xml","files":["elife-15043-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-resp-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15043-resp-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
