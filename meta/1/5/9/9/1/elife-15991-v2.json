Mutations in <italic>NFU1</italic> and <italic>BOLA3</italic> have been linked to genetic diseases with defects in mitochondrial Fe-S centers. Through genetic studies in yeast, we demonstrate that Nfu1 functions in a late step of [4Fe-4S] cluster biogenesis that is of heightened importance during oxidative metabolism. Proteomic studies revealed Nfu1 physical interacts with components of the ISA [4Fe-4S] assembly complex and client proteins that need [4Fe-4S] clusters to function. Additional studies focused on the mitochondrial BolA proteins, Bol1 and Bol3 (yeast homolog to human BOLA3), revealing that Bol1 functions earlier in Fe-S biogenesis with the monothiol glutaredoxin, Grx5, and Bol3 functions late with Nfu1. Given these observations, we propose that Nfu1, assisted by Bol3, functions to facilitate Fe-S transfer from the biosynthetic apparatus to the client proteins preventing oxidative damage to [4Fe-4S] clusters.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15991"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15991"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15991","entryfile":"elife-15991-v2.xml","files":["elife-15991-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15991-v1.xml"]}
