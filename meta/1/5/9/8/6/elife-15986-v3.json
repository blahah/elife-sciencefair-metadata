{"title":"Place cells on a maze encode routes rather than destinations","author":[{"surname":"Grieves","given-names":"Roddy M"},{"surname":"Wood","given-names":"Emma R"},{"surname":"Dudchenko","given-names":"Paul A"}],"abstract":"Hippocampal place cells fire at different rates when a rodent runs through a given location on its way to different destinations. However, it is unclear whether such firing represents the animal’s intended destination or the execution of a specific trajectory. To distinguish between these possibilities, Lister Hooded rats (n = 8) were trained to navigate from a start box to three goal locations via four partially overlapping routes. Two of these led to the same goal location. Of the cells that fired on these two routes, 95.8% showed route-dependent firing (firing on only one route), whereas only two cells (4.2%) showed goal-dependent firing (firing similarly on both routes). In addition, route-dependent place cells over-represented the less discriminable routes, and place cells in general over-represented the start location. These results indicate that place cell firing on overlapping routes reflects the animal’s route, not its goals, and that this firing may aid spatial discrimination.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15986"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15986"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15986","entryfile":"elife-15986-v3.xml","files":["elife-15986-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15986-v1.xml","elife-15986-v2.xml"]}
