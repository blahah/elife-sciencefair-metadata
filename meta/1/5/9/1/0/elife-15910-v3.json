Here we report the 5.9 Ã… structure of HIV-1 TAR in complex with HIV-1 Tat and human AFF4, CDK9, and CycT1. The TAR central loop contacts the CycT1 Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM) and the second Tat Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) shows that AFF4 helix 2 is stabilized in the TAR complex despite not touching the RNA, explaining how it enhances TAR binding to the SEC 50-fold. RNA SHAPE and SAXS data were used to help model the extended (Tat Arginine-Rich Motif) ARM, which enters the TAR major groove between the bulge and the central loop. The structure and functional assays collectively support an integrative structure and a bipartite binding model, wherein the TAR central loop engages the CycT1 TRM and compact core of Tat, while the TAR major groove interacts with the extended Tat ARM.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15910"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15910"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15910","entryfile":"elife-15910-v3.xml","files":["elife-15910-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15910-resp-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15910-v1.xml","elife-15910-v2.xml"]}
