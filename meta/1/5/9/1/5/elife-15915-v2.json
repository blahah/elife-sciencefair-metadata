However, it appears that the distribution of blood capillaries largely ignores these functional boundaries. Here we report that, by contrast, astrocytes, a major player in blood-flow control, show a striking morphological sensitivity to functional borders. Specifically, we show that astrocyte processes are structurally confined by barrel boundaries in the mouse, by the border of primary auditory cortex in the rat and by layers IIIa/b and Cytochrome Oxidase (CO)-blobs boundaries in the human primary visual cortex. Thus, astrocytes which are critical elements in neuro-hemodynamic coupling show a significant anatomical segregation along functional boundaries across different mammalian species. These results may open a new anatomical marker for delineating functional borders across species, including post-mortem human brains.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15915"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15915"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15915","entryfile":"elife-15915-v2.xml","files":["elife-15915-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15915-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15915-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15915-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15915-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15915-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15915-v1.xml"]}
