Here, we report miR-139-5p as another new p53 microRNA target. p53 induced the transcription of miR-139-5p, which in turn suppressed the protein levels of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), an oncogenic protein involved in multiple tumor promoting processes. Knockdown of p53 reversed these effects. Also, overexpression of miR-139-5p decreased PDE4D levels and increased cellular cAMP levels, leading to BIM-mediated cell growth arrest. Furthermore, our analysis of human colorectal tumor specimens revealed significant inverse correlation between the expression of miR-139-5p and that of PDE4D. Finally, overexpression of miR-139-5p suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors, accompanied by decrease in PDE4D and increase in BIM. These results demonstrate that p53 inactivates oncogenic PDE4D by inducing the expression of miR-139-5p.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15978"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15978"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15978","entryfile":"elife-15978-v2.xml","files":["elife-15978-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig4-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15978-v1.xml"]}
