{"title":"The endoplasmic reticulum, not the pH gradient, drives calcium refilling of lysosomes","author":[{"surname":"Garrity","given-names":"Abigail G"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Wuyang"},{"surname":"Collier","given-names":"Crystal MD"},{"surname":"Levey","given-names":"Sara A"},{"surname":"Gao","given-names":"Qiong"},{"surname":"Xu","given-names":"Haoxing"}],"abstract":"Impaired homeostasis of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> causes lysosome dysfunction and lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), but the mechanisms by which lysosomes acquire and refill Ca<sup>2+</sup> are not known. We developed a physiological assay to monitor lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling using specific activators of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to repeatedly induce lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. In contrast to the prevailing view that lysosomal acidification drives Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the lysosome, inhibiting the V-ATPase H<sup>+</sup> pump did not prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. Instead, pharmacological depletion or chelation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> prevented lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores from refilling. More specifically, antagonists of ER IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) rapidly and completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling of lysosomes, but not in cells lacking IP3Rs. Furthermore, reducing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> or blocking IP3Rs caused a dramatic LSD-like lysosome storage phenotype. By closely apposing each other, the ER may serve as a direct and primary source of Ca<sup>2+</sup>for the lysosome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15887"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15887"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15887","entryfile":"elife-15887-v2.xml","files":["elife-15887-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15887-v1.xml"]}
