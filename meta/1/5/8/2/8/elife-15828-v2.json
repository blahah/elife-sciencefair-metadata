The recent discovery of prevalent ESR1 mutations in relapsed tumors underscores a sustained reliance of advanced tumors on ERα signaling, and provides a strong rationale for continued targeting of ERα. Here we describe GDC-0810, a novel, non-steroidal, orally bioavailable selective ER downregulator (SERD), which was identified by prospectively optimizing ERα degradation, antagonism and pharmacokinetic properties. GDC-0810 induces a distinct ERα conformation, relative to that induced by currently approved therapeutics, suggesting a unique mechanism of action. GDC-0810 has robust in vitro and in vivo activity against a variety of human breast cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts, including a tamoxifen-resistant model and those that harbor ERα mutations. GDC-0810 is currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical studies in women with ER+ breast cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15828"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15828"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15828","entryfile":"elife-15828-v2.xml","files":["elife-15828-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15828-v1.xml"]}
