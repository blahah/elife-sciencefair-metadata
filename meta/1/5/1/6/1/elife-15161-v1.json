Two seemingly conflicting models have been proposed for its function: one proposes that MYC enhances expression of all genes, while the other model suggests gene-specific regulation. Here, we have explored the hypothesis that specific gene expression profiles arise since promoters differ in affinity for MYC and high-affinity promoters are fully occupied by physiological levels of MYC. We determined cellular MYC levels and used RNA- and ChIP-sequencing to correlate promoter occupancy with gene expression at different concentrations of MYC. Mathematical modeling showed that binding affinities for interactions of MYC with DNA and with core promoter-bound factors, such as WDR5, are sufficient to explain promoter occupancies observed in vivo. Importantly, promoter affinity stratifies different biological processes that are regulated by MYC, explaining why tumor-specific MYC levels induce specific gene expression programs and alter defined biological properties of cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15161"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15161"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15161","entryfile":"elife-15161-v1.xml","files":["elife-15161-app1-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-app2-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-app2-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-app2-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-app2-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15161-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
