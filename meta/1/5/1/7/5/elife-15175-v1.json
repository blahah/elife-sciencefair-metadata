Tumor-specific mutations were detectable in the cyst fluids of 19 of 23 (83%) borderline tumors, 10 of 13 (77%) type I cancers, and 18 of 18 (100%) type II cancers. In contrast, no mutations were found in the cyst fluids of 18 patients with benign tumors or non-neoplastic cysts. Though large, prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the safety and clinical utility of this approach, our results suggest that the genetic evaluation of cyst fluids might be able to inform the management of the large number of women with these lesions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15175"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15175"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15175","entryfile":"elife-15175-v1.xml","files":["elife-15175-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15175-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15175-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15175-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
