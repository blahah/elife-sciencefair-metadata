Mutations in PS1 lead to dominant-inheritance of early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). Although expression of FAD-linked PS1 mutations enhances toxic Aβ production, the importance of other APP metabolites and γ-secretase substrates in the etiology of the disease has not been confirmed. We report that neurons expressing FAD-linked PS1 variants or functionally deficient PS1 exhibit enhanced axodendritic outgrowth due to increased levels of APP intracellular C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). APP expression is required for exuberant neurite outgrowth and hippocampal axonal sprouting observed in knock-in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutation. APP-CTF accumulation initiates CREB signaling cascade through an association of APP-CTF with Gαs protein. We demonstrate that pathological PS1 loss-of-function impinges on neurite formation through a selective APP gain-of-function that could impact on axodendritic connectivity and contribute to aberrant axonal sprouting observed in AD patients.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15645"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15645"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15645","entryfile":"elife-15645-v2.xml","files":["elife-15645-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15645-v1.xml"]}
