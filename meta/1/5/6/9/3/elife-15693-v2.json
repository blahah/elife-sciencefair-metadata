We investigated how nutritional states modulated starvation-induced hyperactivity in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The receptor of the adipokinetic hormone (AKHR), the insect analog of glucagon, was required for starvation-induced hyperactivity. AKHR was expressed in a small group of octopaminergic neurons in the brain. Silencing AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and blocking octopamine signaling in these neurons eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activation of these neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation. Neither AKHR nor AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons were involved in increased food consumption upon starvation, suggesting that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently regulated. Single cell analysis of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons identified the co-expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like receptor (dInR), which imposed suppressive effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity. Therefore, insulin and glucagon signaling exert opposite effects on starvation-induced hyperactivity via a common neural target in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15693"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15693"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15693","entryfile":"elife-15693-v2.xml","files":["elife-15693-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15693-v1.xml"]}
