Vertebrates have three transcriptional factors, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. Among them, Gli3 is a very special transcriptional factor which closely resembles <italic>Cubitus interruptus</italic> (Ci, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) structurally and functionally as a ‘double agent’ for Shh target gene expression. Here we show that Gli3 full-length, but not the truncated form, can be methylated at K436 and K595. This methylation is specifically catalyzed by Set7, a lysine methyltransferase (KMT). Methylation at K436 and K595 respectively increases the stability and DNA binding ability of Gli3, resulting in an enhancement of Shh signaling activation. Furthermore, functional experiments indicate that the Gli3 methylation contributes to the tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that Set7 mediated methylation is a novel PTM of Gli3, which positively regulates the transactivity of Gli3 and the activation of Shh signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15690"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15690"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15690","entryfile":"elife-15690-v2.xml","files":["elife-15690-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15690-v1.xml"]}
