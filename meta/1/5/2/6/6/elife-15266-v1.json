We use a genome-wide, haplotype-based, analysis to characterise the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups. We show that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. In fact, most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. Our in-depth analysis provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15266"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15266"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15266","entryfile":"elife-15266-v1.xml","files":["elife-15266-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15266-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
