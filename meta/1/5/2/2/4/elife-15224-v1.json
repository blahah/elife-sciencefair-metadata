However, the mechanism by which microglia contribute to the disorder is unclear and recent data suggest that microglia do not play a causative role<xref>undefined</xref>. Here, we use the retinogeniculate system to determine if and how microglia contribute to pathogenesis in a RTT mouse model, the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mouse (<italic>Mecp2</italic>). We demonstrate that microglia contribute to pathogenesis by excessively engulfing, thereby eliminating, presynaptic inputs at end stages of disease (â‰¥P56 <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice) concomitant with synapse loss. Furthermore, loss or gain of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression specifically in microglia (<italic>Cx3cr1;Mecp2</italic>or <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup>eER</sup>; <italic>Mecp2</italic>) had little effect on excessive engulfment, synapse loss, or phenotypic abnormalities. Taken together, our data suggest that microglia contribute to end stages of disease by dismantling neural circuits rendered vulnerable by loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in other CNS cell types.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15224"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15224"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15224","entryfile":"elife-15224-v1.xml","files":["elife-15224-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-15224-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
