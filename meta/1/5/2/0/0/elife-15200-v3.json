Understanding how connections form during evolution, in disease and across individuals requires knowledge of the basic tenets that govern kinase-substrate interactions. We identify criteria sufficient for establishing regulatory links between a MAPK and a non-native substrate. The yeast MAPK Fus3 and human MAPK ERK2 can be functionally redirected if only two conditions are met: the kinase and substrate contain matching interaction domains and the substrate includes a phospho-motif that can be phosphorylated by the kinase and recruit a downstream effector. We used a panel of interaction domains and phosphorylation-activated degradation motifs to demonstrate modular and scalable retargeting. We applied our approach to reshape the signaling behavior of an existing kinase pathway. Together, our results demonstrate that a MAPK can be largely defined by its interaction domains and compatible phospho-motifs and provide insight into how MAPK-substrate connections form.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15200"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15200"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15200","entryfile":"elife-15200-v3.xml","files":["elife-15200-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15200-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15200-v1.xml","elife-15200-v2.xml"]}
