{"title":"Optical electrophysiology for probing function and pharmacology of voltage-gated ion channels","author":[{"surname":"Zhang","given-names":"Hongkang"},{"surname":"Reichert","given-names":"Elaine"},{"surname":"Cohen","given-names":"Adam E"}],"abstract":"Voltage-gated ion channels mediate electrical dynamics in excitable tissues and are an important class of drug targets. Channels can gate in sub-millisecond timescales, show complex manifolds of conformational states, and often show state-dependent pharmacology. Mechanistic studies of ion channels typically involve sophisticated voltage-clamp protocols applied through manual or automated electrophysiology. Here, we develop all-optical electrophysiology techniques to study activity-dependent modulation of ion channels, in a format compatible with high-throughput screening. Using optical electrophysiology, we recapitulate many voltage-clamp protocols and apply to Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, a channel implicated in pain. Optical measurements reveal that a sustained depolarization strongly potentiates the inhibitory effect of PF-04856264, a Na<sub>v</sub>1.7-specific blocker. In a pilot screen, we stratify a library of 320 FDA-approved compounds by binding mechanism and kinetics, and find close concordance with patch clamp measurements. Optical electrophysiology provides a favorable tradeoff between throughput and information content for studies of Na<sub>V</sub> channels, and possibly other voltage-gated channels.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15202"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15202"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15202","entryfile":"elife-15202-v3.xml","files":["elife-15202-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15202-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15202-v1.xml","elife-15202-v2.xml"]}
