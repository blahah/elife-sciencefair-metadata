In this study, we describe a novel subset of murine dermal perivascular macrophages that extend protrusions across the endothelial junctions in steady-state and capture blood-borne macromolecules. Unlike other skin-resident macrophages that are reconstituted by bone marrow-derived progenitors after a genotoxic insult, these cells are replenished by an extramedullary radio-resistant and UV-sensitive Bmi1<sup>+</sup> progenitor. Furthermore, they possess a distinctive anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile, which cannot be polarized under inflammatory conditions, and are involved in repair and remodeling functions for which other skin-resident macrophages appear dispensable. Based on all their properties, we define these macrophages as Skin Transendothelial Radio-resistant Anti-inflammatory Macrophages (STREAM) and postulate that their preservation is important for skin homeostasis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15251"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15251"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15251","entryfile":"elife-15251-v3.xml","files":["elife-15251-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig10-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig9-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15251-v1.xml","elife-15251-v2.xml"]}
