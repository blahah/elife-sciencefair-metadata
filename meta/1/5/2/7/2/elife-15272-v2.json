In 2007, an outbreak in the Federated States of Micronesia sparked public health concern. In 2013, the virus began to spread across other parts of Oceania and in 2015, a large outbreak in Latin America began in Brazil. Possible associations with microcephaly and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome observed in this outbreak have raised concerns about continued global spread of Zika virus, prompting its declaration as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. We conducted species distribution modelling to map environmental suitability for Zika. We show a large portion of tropical and sub-tropical regions globally have suitable environmental conditions with over 2.17 billion people inhabiting these areas.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15272"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15272"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15272","entryfile":"elife-15272-v2.xml","files":["elife-15272-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15272-v1.xml"]}
