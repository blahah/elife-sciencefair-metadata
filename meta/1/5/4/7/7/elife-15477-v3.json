In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15477"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15477"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15477","entryfile":"elife-15477-v3.xml","files":["elife-15477-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig5-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15477-v1.xml","elife-15477-v2.xml"]}
