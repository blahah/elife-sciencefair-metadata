The MRTFs bind G-actin, and signal-regulated changes in cellular G-actin concentration control their nuclear accumulation. The MRTFs also undergo Rho- and ERK-dependent phosphorylation, but the function of MRTF phosphorylation, and the elements and signals involved in MRTF-A nuclear export are largely unexplored. We show that Rho-dependent MRTF-A phosphorylation reflects relief from an inhibitory function of nuclear actin. We map multiple sites of serum-induced phosphorylation, most of which are S/T-P motifs and show that S/T-P phosphorylation is required for transcriptional activation. ERK-mediated S98 phosphorylation inhibits assembly of G-actin complexes on the MRTF-A regulatory RPEL domain, promoting nuclear import. In contrast, S33 phosphorylation potentiates the activity of an autonomous Crm1-dependent N-terminal NES, which cooperates with five other NES elements to exclude MRTF-A from the nucleus. Phosphorylation thus plays positive and negative roles in the regulation of MRTF-A.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15460"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15460"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15460","entryfile":"elife-15460-v2.xml","files":["elife-15460-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15460-v1.xml"]}
