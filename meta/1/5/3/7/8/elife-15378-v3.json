Participants learned to adapt reaching movements to two conflicting dynamical environments that were each associated with a different tDCS polarity (anodal or cathodal tDCS) on the sensorimotor cortex. That is, we sought to determine whether divergent background activity levels within the sensorimotor cortex (anodal: higher activity; cathodal: lower activity) give rise to distinct motor memories. After a training session, application of each tDCS polarity automatically resulted in the retrieval of the motor memory corresponding to that polarity. These results reveal that artificial modulation of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex through tDCS can act as a context for the formation and recollection of motor memories.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"15378"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.15378"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"15378","entryfile":"elife-15378-v3.xml","files":["elife-15378-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-15378-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-15378-v1.xml","elife-15378-v2.xml"]}
