This may have fatal consequences in newborn babies and result in sudden infant death. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we present a novel breathing brainstem organotypic culture that generates rhythmic neural network and motor activity for 3 weeks. We show that increased CO<sub>2</sub> elicits a gap junction-dependent release of PGE<sub>2</sub>. This alters neural network activity in the preBötzinger rhythm-generating complex and in the chemosensitive brainstem respiratory regions, thereby increasing sigh frequency and the depth of inspiration. We used mice lacking eicosanoid prostanoid 3 receptors (EP3R), breathing brainstem organotypic slices and optogenetic inhibition of EP3R<sup>+/+</sup> cells to demonstrate that the EP3R is important for the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Our study identifies a novel pathway linking the inflammatory and respiratory systems, with implications for inspiration and sighs throughout life, and the ability to autoresuscitate when breathing fails.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14170"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14170"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14170","entryfile":"elife-14170-v2.xml","files":["elife-14170-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig11-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig13-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14170-v1.xml"]}
