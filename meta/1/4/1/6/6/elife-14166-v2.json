{"title":"Single molecule analysis reveals reversible and irreversible steps during spliceosome activation","author":[{"surname":"Hoskins","given-names":"Aaron A"},{"surname":"Rodgers","given-names":"Margaret L"},{"surname":"Friedman","given-names":"Larry J"},{"surname":"Gelles","given-names":"Jeff"},{"surname":"Moore","given-names":"Melissa J"}],"abstract":"The spliceosome is a complex machine composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and accessory proteins that excises introns from pre-mRNAs. After assembly the spliceosome is activated for catalysis by rearrangement of subunits to form an active site. How this rearrangement is coordinated is not well-understood. During activation, U4 must be released to allow U6 conformational change, while Prp19 complex (NTC) recruitment is essential for stabilizing the active site. We used multi-wavelength colocalization single molecule spectroscopy to directly observe the key events in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> spliceosome activation. Following binding of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, the spliceosome either reverses assembly by discarding tri-snRNP or proceeds to activation by irreversible U4 loss. The major pathway for NTC recruitment occurs after U4 release. ATP stimulates both the competing U4 release and tri-snRNP discard processes. The data reveal the activation mechanism and show that overall splicing efficiency may be maintained through repeated rounds of disassembly and tri-snRNP reassociation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14166"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14166"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14166","entryfile":"elife-14166-v2.xml","files":["elife-14166-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14166-v1.xml"]}
