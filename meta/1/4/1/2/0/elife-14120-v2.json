The hippocampus, however, has been treated as a unitary structure in anxiety and fear research despite mounting evidence that different hippocampal subregions have specialized roles in other cognitive domains. Using novel cell-type- and region-specific conditional knockouts of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α2 subunit, we demonstrate that inhibition of the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus and CA3 via α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) is required to suppress anxiety, while the inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is required to suppress fear responses. We further show that the diazepam-modulation of hippocampal theta activity shows certain parallels with our behavioral findings, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed behavioral effects. Thus, our findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the regulation of anxiety versus fear by hippocampal microcircuitry.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14120"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14120"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14120","entryfile":"elife-14120-v2.xml","files":["elife-14120-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14120-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14120-v1.xml"]}
