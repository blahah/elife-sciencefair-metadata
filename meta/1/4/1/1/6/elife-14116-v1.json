We report here on a posture control system in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that coordinates these needs. Using quantitative posture analysis we explain worm locomotion as a composite of two modes: regular undulations versus flexible turning. Graded reciprocal regulation of both modes allows animals to flexibly adapt their locomotion strategy under sensory stimulation along a spectrum ranging from LDT to ARS. Using genetics and functional imaging of neural activity we characterize the counteracting interneurons AVK and DVA that utilize FLP-1 and NLP-12 neuropeptides to control both motor modes. Gradual regulation of behaviors via this system is required for spatial navigation during chemotaxis. This work shows how a nervous system controls simple elementary features of posture to generate complex movements for goal-directed locomotion strategies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14116"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14116"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14116","entryfile":"elife-14116-v1.xml","files":["elife-14116-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14116-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
