{"title":"Viral hijacking of a replicative helicase loader and its implications for helicase loading control and phage replication","author":[{"surname":"Hood","given-names":"Iris V"},{"surname":"Berger","given-names":"James M"}],"abstract":"Replisome assembly requires the loading of replicative hexameric helicases onto origins by AAA+ ATPases. How loader activity is appropriately controlled remains unclear. Here, we use structural and biochemical analyses to establish how an antimicrobial phage protein interferes with the function of the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> replicative helicase loader, DnaI. The viral protein binds to the loaderâ€™s AAA+ ATPase domain, allowing binding of the host replicative helicase but impeding loader self-assembly and ATPase activity. Close inspection of the complex highlights an unexpected locus for the binding of an interdomain linker element in DnaI/DnaC-family proteins. We find that the inhibitor protein is genetically coupled to a phage-encoded homolog of the bacterial helicase loader, which we show binds to the host helicase but not to the inhibitor itself. These findings establish a new approach by which viruses can hijack host replication processes and explain how loader activity is internally regulated to prevent aberrant auto-association.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14158"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14158"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14158","entryfile":"elife-14158-v3.xml","files":["elife-14158-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14158-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14158-v1.xml","elife-14158-v2.xml"]}
