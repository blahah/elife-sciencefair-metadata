Rodent models of DYT1 dystonia, a motor disorder caused by a single gene mutation, demonstrate increased long-term potentiation and decreased long-term depression in corticostriatal synapses. Computationally, such asymmetric learning predicts risk taking in probabilistic tasks. Here we demonstrate abnormal risk taking in DYT1 dystonia patients, which is correlated with disease severity, thereby supporting striatal plasticity in shaping choice behavior in humans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14155"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14155"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14155","entryfile":"elife-14155-v3.xml","files":["elife-14155-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-fig3-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-resp-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14155-v1.xml","elife-14155-v2.xml"]}
