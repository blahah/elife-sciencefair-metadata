Recent studies have suggested cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition could represent a novel treatment approach or augmentation strategy for affective disorders including anxiety disorders and major depression. We show that traditional COX-2 inhibitors and a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor (SSCI) reduce a variety of stress-induced behavioral pathologies in mice. We found that these behavioral effects were associated with a dampening of neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) ex vivo and in vivo, and were mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel and CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation. Taken together, these data provide further support for the potential utility of SSCIs, as well as traditional COX-2 inhibitors, as novel treatment approaches for stress-related psychiatric disorders.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14137"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14137"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14137","entryfile":"elife-14137-v1.xml","files":["elife-14137-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14137-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
