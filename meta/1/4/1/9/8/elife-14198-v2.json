Surprisingly, despite the diversity of these features, we have found that deleting <italic>Mecp2</italic> only from GABAergic inhibitory neurons in mice replicates most of this phenotype. Here we show that genetically restoring <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression only in GABAergic neurons of male <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice enhanced inhibitory signaling, extended lifespan, and rescued ataxia, apraxia, and social abnormalities but did not rescue tremor or anxiety. Female <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice showed a less dramatic but still substantial rescue. These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of GABAergic neurons in certain behaviors and suggest that modulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance through GABAergic neurons could prove a viable therapeutic option in Rett syndrome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14198"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14198"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14198","entryfile":"elife-14198-v2.xml","files":["elife-14198-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14198-v1.xml"]}
