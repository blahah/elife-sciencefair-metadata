{"title":"Cellular resolution circuit mapping with temporal-focused excitation of soma-targeted channelrhodopsin","author":[{"surname":"Baker","given-names":"Christopher A"},{"surname":"Elyada","given-names":"Yishai M"},{"surname":"Parra","given-names":"Andres"},{"surname":"Bolton","given-names":"M McLean"}],"abstract":"We describe refinements in optogenetic methods for circuit mapping that enable measurements of functional synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. By expanding a two-photon beam in the imaging plane using the temporal focusing method and restricting channelrhodopsin to the soma and proximal dendrites, we are able to reliably evoke action potentials in individual neurons, verify spike generation with GCaMP6s, and determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14193"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14193"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14193","entryfile":"elife-14193-v2.xml","files":["elife-14193-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14193-v1.xml"]}
