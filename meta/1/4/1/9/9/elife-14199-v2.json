Although mouse models of Rett syndrome (RTT), a postnatal neurological disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in <italic>MECP2,</italic> display impaired excitatory neurotransmission, the RTT phenotype can be largely reproduced in mice simply by removing MeCP2 from inhibitory GABAergic neurons. To determine what role excitatory signaling impairment might play in RTT pathogenesis, we generated conditional mouse models with <italic>Mecp2</italic> either removed from or expressed solely in glutamatergic neurons. MeCP2 deficiency in glutamatergic neurons leads to early lethality, obesity, tremor, altered anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired acoustic startle response, which is distinct from the phenotype of mice lacking MeCP2 only in inhibitory neurons. These findings reveal a role for excitatory signaling impairment in specific neurobehavioral abnormalities shared by RTT and other postnatal neurological disorders.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14199"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14199"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14199","entryfile":"elife-14199-v2.xml","files":["elife-14199-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14199-v1.xml"]}
