Here we discern the functional architecture of human NELF through X-ray crystallography, protein crosslinking, biochemical assays, and RNA crosslinking in cells. We identify a NELF core subcomplex formed by conserved regions in subunits NELF-A and NELF-C, and resolve its crystal structure. The NELF-AC subcomplex binds single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro, and NELF-C associates with RNA in vivo. A positively charged face of NELF-AC is involved in RNA binding, whereas the opposite face of the NELF-AC subcomplex binds NELF-B. NELF-B is predicted to form a HEAT repeat fold, also binds RNA in vivo, and anchors the subunit NELF-E, which is confirmed to bind RNA in vivo. These results reveal the three-dimensional architecture and three RNA-binding faces of NELF.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14981"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14981"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14981","entryfile":"elife-14981-v2.xml","files":["elife-14981-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14981-v1.xml"]}
