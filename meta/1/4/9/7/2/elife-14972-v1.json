Can this altered belief about the body also affect physiological mechanisms involved in body-ownership, such as motor control? Here we ask whether the excitability of the motor pathways to the real (disembodied) hand are affected by the illusion. Our results show that the amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials recorded from the real hand is significantly reduced, with respect to baseline, when subjects in the synchronous (but not in the asynchronous) condition experience the fake hand as their own. This finding contributes to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between body-ownership and motor system, and provides the first physiological evidence that a significant drop in motor excitability in M1 hand circuits accompanies the disembodiment of the real hand during the RHI experience.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14972"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14972"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14972","entryfile":"elife-14972-v1.xml","files":["elife-14972-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14972-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14972-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
