{"title":"Genetic dissection of the Transcription Factor code controlling serial specification of muscle identities in <italic>Drosophila</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Dubois","given-names":"Laurence"},{"surname":"Frendo","given-names":"Jean-Louis"},{"surname":"Chanut-Delalande","given-names":"Hélène"},{"surname":"Crozatier","given-names":"Michèle"},{"surname":"Vincent","given-names":"Alain"}],"abstract":"Each <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle is seeded by one Founder Cell issued from terminal division of a Progenitor Cell (PC). Muscle identity reflects the expression by each PC of a specific combination of identity Transcription Factors (iTFs). Sequential emergence of several PCs at the same position raised the question of how developmental time controlled muscle identity. Here, we identified roles of Anterior Open and ETS domain lacking in controlling PC birth time and Eyes absent, No Ocelli, and Sine oculis in specifying PC identity. The windows of transcription of these and other TFs in wild type and mutant embryos, revealed a cascade of regulation integrating time and space, feed-forward loops and use of alternative transcription start sites. These data provide a dynamic view of the transcriptional control of muscle identity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and an extended framework for studying interactions between general myogenic factors and iTFs in evolutionary diversification of muscle shapes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14979"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14979"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14979","entryfile":"elife-14979-v2.xml","files":["elife-14979-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14979-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14979-v1.xml"]}
