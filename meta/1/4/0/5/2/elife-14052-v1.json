The cAMP dynamics in these subcellular compartments are ill-defined. We introduce a novel FRET-based cAMP biosensor with nanomolar sensitivity that is out of reach for other sensors. To measure cAMP dynamics in the sperm flagellum, we generated transgenic mice and reveal that the hitherto methods determining total cAMP levels do not reflect changes in free cAMP levels. Moreover, cAMP dynamics in the midpiece and principal piece of the flagellum are distinctively different. The sole cAMP source in the flagellum is the soluble adenylate cyclase (SACY). Although bicarbonate-dependent SACY activity requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, basal SACY activity is suppressed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Finally, we also applied the sensor to primary cilia. Our new cAMP biosensor features unique characteristics that allow gaining new insights into cAMP signaling and unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14052"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14052"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14052","entryfile":"elife-14052-v1.xml","files":["elife-14052-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14052-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
