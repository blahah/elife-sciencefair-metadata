However, key regulators of ubiquitination during innate response and roles of new types of ubiquitination (apart from Lys48- and Lys63-linkage) in control of innate signaling have not been clearly understood. Here we report that F-box only protein Fbxo21, a functionally unknown component of SCF (Skp1–Cul1–F-box protein) complex, facilitates Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), and promotes type I interferon production upon viral infection. Fbxo21 deficiency in mice cells impairs virus-induced Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1, attenuates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathway, and decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon, resulting in reduced antiviral innate response and enhanced virus replication. Therefore Fbxo21 is required for ASK1 activation via Lys29-linkage of ASK1 during antiviral innate response, providing mechanistic insights into non-proteolytic roles of SCF complex in innate immune response.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14087"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14087"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14087","entryfile":"elife-14087-v2.xml","files":["elife-14087-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14087-v1.xml"]}
