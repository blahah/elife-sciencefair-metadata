{"title":"A FRET-based study reveals site-specific regulation of spindle position checkpoint proteins at yeast centrosomes","author":[{"surname":"Gryaznova","given-names":"Yuliya"},{"surname":"Caydasi","given-names":"Ayse Koca"},{"surname":"Malengo","given-names":"Gabriele"},{"surname":"Sourjik","given-names":"Victor"},{"surname":"Pereira","given-names":"Gislene"}],"abstract":"The spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) is a spindle pole body (SPB, equivalent of mammalian centrosome) associated surveillance mechanism that halts mitotic exit upon spindle mis-orientation. Here, we monitored the interaction between SPB proteins and the SPOC component Bfa1 by FRET microscopy. We show that Bfa1 binds to the scaffold-protein Nud1 and the γ-tubulin receptor Spc72. Spindle misalignment specifically disrupts Bfa1-Spc72 interaction by a mechanism that requires the 14-3-3-family protein Bmh1 and the MARK/PAR-kinase Kin4. Dissociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 prevents the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by the polo-like kinase Cdc5. We propose Spc72 as a regulatory hub that coordinates the activity of Kin4 and Cdc5 towards Bfa1. In addition, analysis of <italic>spc72</italic>∆ cells shows that a mitotic-exit-promoting dominant signal, which is triggered upon elongation of the spindle into the bud, overrides the SPOC. Our data reinforce the importance of daughter-cell-associated factors and centrosome-based regulations in mitotic exit and SPOC control.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14029"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14029"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14029","entryfile":"elife-14029-v4.xml","files":["elife-14029-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig1-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig1-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig1-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14029-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14029-v1.xml","elife-14029-v2.xml","elife-14029-v3.xml"]}
