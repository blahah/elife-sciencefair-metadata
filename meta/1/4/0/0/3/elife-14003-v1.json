During a typhoid clinical treatment trial in Nepal, we observed several treatment failures and isolated highly fluoroquinolone-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi (<italic>S</italic>. Typhi). Seventy-eight <italic>S.</italic> Typhi isolates were genome sequenced and clinical observations, treatment failures and fever clearance times (FCTs) were stratified by lineage. Most fluoroquinolone-resistant <italic>S</italic>. Typhi belonged to a specific H58 subclade. Treatment failure with <italic>S.</italic> Typhi-H58 was significantly less frequent with ceftriaxone (3/31; 9.7%) than gatifloxacin (15/34; 44.1%)(Hazard Ratio 0.19, p=0.002). Further, for gatifloxacin-treated patients, those infected with fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms had significantly higher median FCTs (8.2 days) than those infected with susceptible (2.96) or intermediately resistant organisms (4.01)(p<0.001). H58 is the dominant <italic>S.</italic> Typhi clade internationally, but there are no data regarding disease outcome with this organism. We report an emergent new subclade of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi-H58 that is associated with fluoroquinolone treatment failure.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14003"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14003"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14003","entryfile":"elife-14003-v1.xml","files":["elife-14003-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14003-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14003-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14003-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
