The MEN is a signaling cascade that localizes to spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and activates the phosphatase Cdc14. There are two competing models that explain MEN regulation by spindle position. In the 'zone model', exit from mitosis occurs when a MEN-bearing SPB enters the bud. The 'cMT-bud neck model' posits that cytoplasmic microtubule (cMT)-bud neck interactions prevent MEN activity. Here we find that 1) eliminating cMTâ€“ bud neck interactions does not trigger exit from mitosis and 2) loss of these interactions does not precede Cdc14 activation. Furthermore, using binucleate cells, we show that exit from mitosis occurs when one SPB enters the bud despite the presence of a mispositioned spindle. We conclude that exit from mitosis is triggered by a correctly positioned spindle rather than inhibited by improper spindle position.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14036"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14036"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14036","entryfile":"elife-14036-v2.xml","files":["elife-14036-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14036-v1.xml"]}
