While their role is not fully understood, they are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3’-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu). In this study, we found that, in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a circadian expression pattern. Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14837"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14837"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14837","entryfile":"elife-14837-v2.xml","files":["elife-14837-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14837-v1.xml"]}
