Diffuse invasion of the brain parenchyma, including along preexisting blood vessels, is a leading cause of therapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that ephrin-B2 mediates GSC perivascular invasion. Intravital imaging, coupled with mechanistic studies in murine GBM models and patient-derived GSC, revealed that endothelial ephrin-B2 compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells. In contrast, upregulation of the same ephrin-B2 ligand in GSC enabled perivascular migration through homotypic forward signalling. Surprisingly, ephrin-B2 reverse signalling also promoted tumourigenesis cell-autonomously, by mediating anchorage-independent cytokinesis via RhoA. In human GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts, <italic>EFNB2</italic> knock-down blocked tumour initiation and treatment of established tumours with ephrin-B2-blocking antibodies suppressed progression. Thus, our results indicate that targeting ephrin-B2 may be an effective strategy for the simultaneous inhibition of invasion and proliferation in GBM.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14845"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14845"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14845","entryfile":"elife-14845-v1.xml","files":["elife-14845-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14845-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
