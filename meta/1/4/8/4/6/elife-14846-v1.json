But late-LTP and memory are maintained without PKMζ in PKMζ-null mice. Two hypotheses can account for these findings. First, PKMζ is unimportant for LTP or memory. Second, PKMζ is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and PKMζ-null mice recruit compensatory mechanisms. We find that whereas PKMζ persistently increases in LTP maintenance in wild-type mice, PKCι/λ, a gene-product closely related to PKMζ, persistently increases in LTP maintenance in PKMζ-null mice. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find PKMζ-antisense in hippocampus blocks late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type mice, but not in PKMζ-null mice without the target mRNA. Conversely, a PKCι/λ-antagonist disrupts late-LTP and spatial memory in PKMζ-null mice but not in wild-type mice. Thus, whereas PKMζ is essential for wild-type LTP and long-term memory, persistent PKCι/λ activation compensates for PKMζ loss in PKMζ-null mice.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14846"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14846"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14846","entryfile":"elife-14846-v1.xml","files":["elife-14846-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14846-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
