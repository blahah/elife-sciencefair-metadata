Here, we have mapped with electron microscopy the complete wiring diagram of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval antennal lobe, an olfactory neuropil similar to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We found a canonical circuit with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits and behavior.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14859"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14859"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14859","entryfile":"elife-14859-v2.xml","files":["elife-14859-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14859-v1.xml"]}
