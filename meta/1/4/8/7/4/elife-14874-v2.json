Using electron cryo-microscopy of a single specimen, we present five ribosome structures formed with the Taura syndrome virus IRES and translocase eEF2â€¢GTP bound with sordarin. The structures suggest a trajectory of IRES translocation, required for translation initiation, and provide an unprecedented view of eEF2 dynamics. The IRES rearranges from extended to bent to extended conformations. This inchworm-like movement is coupled with ribosomal inter-subunit rotation and 40S head swivel. eEF2, attached to the 60S subunit, slides along the rotating 40S subunit to enter the A site. Its diphthamide-bearing tip at domain IV separates the tRNA-mRNA-like pseudoknot I (PKI) of the IRES from the decoding center. This unlocks 40S domains, facilitating head swivel and biasing IRES translocation <italic>via</italic> hitherto-elusive intermediates with PKI captured between the A and P sites. The structures suggest missing links in our understanding of tRNA translocation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14874"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14874"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14874","entryfile":"elife-14874-v2.xml","files":["elife-14874-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14874-v1.xml"]}
