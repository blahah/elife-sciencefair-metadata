Mammalian cell function is dynamically regulated by the interaction of cell surface galectins with branched N-glycans. Here we report that N-glycan branching deficiency triggers the Golgi to generate bioequivalent N-glycans that preserve galectin-glycoprotein interactions and cellular homeostasis. Galectins bind N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) units within N-glycans initiated from UDP-GlcNAc by the <italic>medial</italic>-Golgi branching enzymes as well as the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi poly-LacNAc extension enzyme Î²1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT). Marginally reducing LacNAc content by limiting N-glycans to three branches results in T-cell hyperactivity and autoimmunity; yet further restricting branching does not produce a more hyperactive state. Rather, new poly-LacNAc extension by B3GNT maintains galectin binding and immune homeostasis. Poly-LacNAc extension is triggered by redistribution of unused UDP-GlcNAc from the <italic>medial</italic> to <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi via inter-cisternal tubules. These data demonstrate the functional equivalency of structurally dissimilar N-glycans and suggest a self-correcting feature of the Golgi that sustains cellular homeostasis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14814"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14814"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14814","entryfile":"elife-14814-v2.xml","files":["elife-14814-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14814-v1.xml"]}
