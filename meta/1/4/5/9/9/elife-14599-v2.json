Here we show that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel (DEG/ENaC) protein, UNC-8, is transcriptionally controlled to function as a trigger in an activity-dependent mechanism that removes synapses in remodeling GABAergic neurons. UNC-8 cation channel activity promotes disassembly of presynaptic domains in DD type GABA neurons, but not in VD class GABA neurons where <italic>unc-8</italic> expression is blocked by the COUP/TF transcription factor, UNC-55. We propose that the depolarizing effect of UNC-8-dependent sodium import elevates intracellular calcium in a positive feedback loop involving the voltage-gated calcium channel UNC-2 and the calcium-activated phosphatase TAX-6/calcineurin to initiate a caspase-dependent mechanism that disassembles the presynaptic apparatus. Thus, UNC-8 serves as a link between genetic and activity-dependent pathways that function together to promote the elimination of GABA synapses in remodeling neurons.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14599"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14599"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14599","entryfile":"elife-14599-v2.xml","files":["elife-14599-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14599-v1.xml"]}
