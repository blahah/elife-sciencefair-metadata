Despite this well-established role in the control of developmental processes in roots, the root cap’s function in nutrition remains obscure. Here, we uncover its role in phosphate nutrition by targeted cellular inactivation or phosphate transport complementation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, using a transactivation strategy with an innovative high-resolution real-time <sup>33</sup>P imaging technique. Remarkably, the diminutive size of the root cap cells at the root-to-soil exchange surface accounts for a significant amount of the total seedling phosphate uptake (approximately 20%). This level of Pi absorption is sufficient for shoot biomass production (up to a 180% gain in soil), as well as repression of Pi starvation-induced genes. These results extend our understanding of this important tissue from its previously described roles in environmental perception to novel functions in mineral nutrition and homeostasis control.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14577"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14577"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14577","entryfile":"elife-14577-v1.xml","files":["elife-14577-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14577-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
