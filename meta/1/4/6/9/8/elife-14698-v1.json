One celebrated enigma in cardiac evolution involves the transition from a cardiac outflow tract dominated by a multi-valved conus arteriosus in basal actinopterygians, to an outflow tract commanded by the non-valved, elastic, bulbus arteriosus in higher actinopterygians. We demonstrate that cardiac preservation is possible in the extinct fish <italic>Rhacolepis buccalis</italic> from the Brazilian Cretaceous. Using X-ray synchrotron microtomography, we show that <italic>Rhacolepis</italic> fossils display hearts with a conus arteriosus containing at least five valve rows. This represents a transitional morphology between the primitive, multivalvar, conal condition and the derived, monovalvar, bulbar state of the outflow tract in modern actinopterygians. Our data rescue a long-lost cardiac phenotype (119-113 Ma) and suggest that outflow tract simplification in actinopterygians is compatible with a gradual, rather than a drastic saltation event. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of studying cardiac evolution in fossils.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14698"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14698"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14698","entryfile":"elife-14698-v1.xml","files":["elife-14698-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14698-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14698-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14698-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
