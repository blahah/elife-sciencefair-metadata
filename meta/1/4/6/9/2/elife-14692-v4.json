{"title":"Co-expression of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/</italic>20 defines a transient mesendoderm regulatory state in ascidian embryos","author":[{"surname":"Hudson","given-names":"Clare"},{"surname":"Sirour","given-names":"Cathy"},{"surname":"Yasuo","given-names":"Hitoyoshi"}],"abstract":"In many bilaterian embryos, nuclear β-catenin (nβ-catenin) promotes mesendoderm over ectoderm lineages. Although this is likely to represent an evolutionary ancient developmental process, the regulatory architecture of nβ-catenin-induced mesendoderm remains elusive in the majority of animals. Here, we show that, in ascidian embryos, three nβ-catenin transcriptional targets, <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/</italic>20, are each required for the correct initiation of both the mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks. Conversely, these three factors are sufficient, in combination, to produce a mesendoderm ground state that can be further programmed into mesoderm or endoderm lineages. Importantly, we show that the combinatorial activity of these three factors is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to mesendoderm. We conclude that in ascidian embryos, the transient mesendoderm regulatory state is defined by co-expression of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/</italic>20.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14692"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14692"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14692","entryfile":"elife-14692-v4.xml","files":["elife-14692-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig2-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig5-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-14692-v1.xml","elife-14692-v2.xml","elife-14692-v3.xml"]}
