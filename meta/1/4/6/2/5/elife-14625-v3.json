Here, we directly estimated the spontaneous mutation rate by sequencing new <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutation accumulation lines maintained with minimal natural selection. We inferred strong stabilizing natural selection on quantitative traits because genetic variation among wild-derived inbred lines was much lower than predicted from a neutral model and the mutational effects were much larger than allelic effects of standing polymorphisms. Stabilizing selection could act directly on the traits, or indirectly from pleiotropic effects on fitness. However, our data are not consistent with simple models of mutation-stabilizing selection balance; therefore, further empirical work is needed to assess the balance of evolutionary forces responsible for quantitative genetic variation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14625"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14625"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"14625","entryfile":"elife-14625-v3.xml","files":["elife-14625-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig11-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig12-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig13-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig14-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14625-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14625-v1.xml","elife-14625-v2.xml"]}
