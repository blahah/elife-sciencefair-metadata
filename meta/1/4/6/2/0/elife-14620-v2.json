Its diverse mechanisms provide the regulatory network with a bigger repertoire to increase complexity. Here we report a novel LncRNA, Lnc34a, that is enriched in colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs) and initiates asymmetric division by directly targeting the microRNA miR-34a to cause its spatial imbalance. Lnc34a recruits Dnmt3a via PHB2 and HDAC1 to methylate and deacetylate the miR-34a promoter simultaneously, hence epigenetically silencing miR-34a expression independent of its upstream regulator, p53. Lnc34a levels affect CCSC self-renewal and colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in xenograft models. Lnc34a is upregulated in late-stage CRCs, contributing to epigenetic miR-34a silencing and CRC proliferation. The fact that lncRNA targets microRNA highlights the regulatory complexity of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which occupy the bulk of the genome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14620"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14620"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14620","entryfile":"elife-14620-v2.xml","files":["elife-14620-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14620-v1.xml"]}
