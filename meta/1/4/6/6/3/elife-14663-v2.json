As Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. We used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5â€™ untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are thus interdependent on one another.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14663"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14663"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14663","entryfile":"elife-14663-v2.xml","files":["elife-14663-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14663-v1.xml"]}
