Using a combination of optogenetic stimulation and 2-photon imaging in mice, we demonstrate that selective activation of cortical excitation and inhibition elicits distinct vascular responses and identify the vasoconstrictive mechanism as Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acting on Y1 receptors. The latter implies that task-related negative Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals in the cerebral cortex under normal physiological conditions may be mainly driven by the NPY-positive inhibitory neurons. Further, the NPY-Y1 pathway may offer a potential therapeutic target in cerebrovascular disease.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14315"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14315"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14315","entryfile":"elife-14315-v2.xml","files":["elife-14315-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14315-v1.xml"]}
