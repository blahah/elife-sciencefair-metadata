We report here the structure of the intact functional assembly responsible for regulating and executing a site-specific DNA recombination reaction. The assembly is a 240-bp Holliday junction (HJ) bound specifically by 11 protein subunits. This higher-order complex is a key intermediate in the tightly regulated pathway for the excision of bacteriophage Î» viral DNA out of the <italic>E. coli</italic> host chromosome, an extensively studied paradigmatic model system for the regulated rearrangement of DNA. Our results provide a structural basis for pre-existing data describing the excisive and integrative recombination pathways, and they help explain their regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14313"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14313"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14313","entryfile":"elife-14313-v1.xml","files":["elife-14313-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14313-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
