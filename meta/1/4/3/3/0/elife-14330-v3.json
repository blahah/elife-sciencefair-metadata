{"title":"A feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny promotes tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis","author":[{"surname":"Chen","given-names":"Jun"},{"surname":"Xu","given-names":"Na"},{"surname":"Huang","given-names":"Huanwei"},{"surname":"Cai","given-names":"Tao"},{"surname":"Xi","given-names":"Rongwen"}],"abstract":"Homeostatic renewal of many adult tissues requires balanced self-renewal and differentiation of local stem cells, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we identified a novel feedback mechanism in controlling intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sox21a, a group B Sox protein, is preferentially expressed in the committed progenitor named enteroblast (EB) to promote enterocyte differentiation. In <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutants, EBs do not divide, but cannot differentiate properly and have increased expression of mitogens, which then act as paracrine signals to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. This leads to a feedback amplification loop for rapid production of differentiation-defective EBs and tumorigenesis. Notably, in normal intestine following damage, Sox21a is temporally downregulated in EBs to allow the activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop for epithelial repair. We propose that executing a feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny could be a common mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14330"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14330"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14330","entryfile":"elife-14330-v3.xml","files":["elife-14330-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14330-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14330-v1.xml","elife-14330-v2.xml"]}
