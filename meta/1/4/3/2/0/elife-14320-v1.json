{"title":"Serial grouping of 2D-image regions with object-based attention in humans","author":[{"surname":"Jeurissen","given-names":"Danique"},{"surname":"Self","given-names":"Matthew W"},{"surname":"Roelfsema","given-names":"Pieter R"}],"abstract":"After an initial stage of local analysis within the retina and early visual pathways, the human visual system creates a structured representation of the visual scene by co-selecting image elements that are part of behaviorally relevant objects. The mechanisms underlying this perceptual organization process are only partially understood. We here investigate the time-course of perceptual grouping of two-dimensional image-regions by measuring the reaction times of human participants and report that it is associated with the gradual spread of object-based attention. Attention spreads fastest over large and homogeneous areas and is slowed down at locations that require small-scale processing. We find that the time-course of the object-based selection process is well explained by a 'growth-cone' model, which selects surface elements in an incremental, scale-dependent manner. We discuss how the visual cortical hierarchy can implement this scale-dependent spread of object-based attention, leveraging the different receptive field sizes in distinct cortical areas.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14320"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14320"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14320","entryfile":"elife-14320-v1.xml","files":["elife-14320-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14320-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
