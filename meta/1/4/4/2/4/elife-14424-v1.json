{"title":"Biological causal links on physiological and evolutionary time scales","author":[{"surname":"Karmon","given-names":"Amit"},{"surname":"Pilpel","given-names":"Yitzhak"}],"abstract":"Correlation does not imply causation. If two variables, say A and B, are correlated, it could be because A causes B, or that B causes A, or because a third factor affects them both. We suggest that in many cases in biology, the causal link might be bi-directional: A causes B through a fast-acting physiological process, while B causes A through a slowly accumulating evolutionary process. Furthermore, many trained biologists tend to consistently focus at first on the fast-acting direction, and overlook the slower process in the opposite direction. We analyse several examples from modern biology that demonstrate this bias (codon usage optimality and gene expression, gene duplication and genetic dispensability, stem cell division and cancer risk, and the microbiome and host metabolism) and also discuss an example from linguistics. These examples demonstrate mutual effects between the fast physiological processes and the slow evolutionary ones. We believe that building awareness of inference biases among biologists who tend to prefer one causal direction over another could improve scientific reasoning.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14424"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14424"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14424","entryfile":"elife-14424-v1.xml","files":["elife-14424-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
