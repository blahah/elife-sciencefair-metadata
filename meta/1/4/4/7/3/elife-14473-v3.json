Here we elucidate further the structure of an <italic>O</italic>-mannose-initiated glycan on alpha-dystroglycan that is required to generate its extracellular matrix-binding polysaccharide. This functional glycan contains a novel ribitol structure that links a phosphotrisaccharide to xylose. ISPD is a CDP-ribitol (ribose) pyrophosphorylase that generates the reduced sugar nucleotide for the insertion of ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage to the glycoprotein. TMEM5 is a UDP-xylosyl transferase that elaborates the structure. We demonstrate in a zebrafish model as well as in a human patient that defects in TMEM5 result in muscular dystrophy in combination with abnormal brain development. Thus, we propose a novel structure—a ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage—for the moiety on which TMEM5, B4GAT1, and LARGE act to generate the functional receptor for ECM proteins having LG domains.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14473"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14473"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14473","entryfile":"elife-14473-v3.xml","files":["elife-14473-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14473-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14473-v1.xml","elife-14473-v2.xml"]}
