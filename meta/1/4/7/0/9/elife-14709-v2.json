Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of <underline>k</underline>inase-<underline>d</underline>ead ATM (<italic>Atm</italic><sup>KD/-</sup>) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (<italic>Atm</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate <italic>Atm</italic><sup>KD/-</sup>, but not Atm-proficientor <italic>Atm</italic><sup>-/-</sup> leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for Topo-isomerase I inhibitor based therapy.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14709"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14709"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14709","entryfile":"elife-14709-v2.xml","files":["elife-14709-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14709-v1.xml"]}
