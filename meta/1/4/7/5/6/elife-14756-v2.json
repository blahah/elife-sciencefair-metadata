However, no synergistic effects of CTX and ACT on the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes in vivo have been described. Here, we visualized key cell events in immunotherapy-elicited immunoreactions in a multicolor-coded tumor microenvironment, and then established an optimal strategy of metronomic combined-immunotherapy to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Intravital imaging data indicated that regulatory T cells formed an 'immunosuppressive ring' around a solid tumor. The CTX-ACT combined-treatment elicited synergistic immunoreactions in tumor areas, which included relieving the immune suppression, triggering the transient activation of endogenous tumor-infiltrating immunocytes, increasing the accumulation of adoptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and accelerating the infiltration of dendritic cells. These insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes are beneficial for optimizing immunotherapy and provide new approaches for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the involvement of immunocytes in cancer immunotherapy.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14756"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14756"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14756","entryfile":"elife-14756-v2.xml","files":["elife-14756-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14756-v1.xml"]}
