We demonstrate in zebrafish that <italic>nf1</italic> loss leads to aberrant activation of RAS signaling in <italic>MYCN</italic>-induced neuroblastomas that arise in these precursors, and that the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) is sufficient to suppress the acceleration of neuroblastoma in <italic>nf1</italic>-deficient fish, but not the hypertrophy of sympathoadrenal cells in <italic>nf1</italic> mutant embryos. Thus, even though neuroblastoma is a classical “developmental tumor”, NF1 relies on a very different mechanism to suppress malignant transformation than it does to modulate normal neural crest cell growth. We also show marked synergy in tumor cell killing between MEK inhibitors (trametinib) and retinoids (isotretinoin) in primary <italic>nf1a-/-</italic> zebrafish neuroblastomas. Thus, our model system has considerable translational potential for investigating new strategies to improve the treatment of very high-risk neuroblastomas with aberrant RAS-MAPK activation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14713"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14713"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14713","entryfile":"elife-14713-v2.xml","files":["elife-14713-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14713-v1.xml"]}
