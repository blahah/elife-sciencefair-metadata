Depletion of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with defects in tumor suppressors <italic>BRCA1, BRCA2</italic> and <italic>PALB2</italic>. RAD52 also participates in the recovery of the stalled replication forks. Anticipating that ssDNA binding activity underlies the RAD52 cellular functions, we carried out a high throughput screening campaign to identify compounds that disrupt the RAD52-ssDNA interaction. Lead compounds were confirmed as RAD52 inhibitors in biochemical assays. Computational analysis predicted that these inhibitors bind within the ssDNA-binding groove of the RAD52 oligomeric ring. The nature of the inhibitor-RAD52 complex was validated through an in silico screening campaign, culminating in the discovery of an additional RAD52 inhibitor. Cellular studies with our inhibitors showed that the RAD52-ssDNA interaction enables its function at stalled replication forks, and that the inhibition of RAD52-ssDNA binding acts additively with BRCA2 or MUS81 depletion in cell killing.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14740"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14740"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14740","entryfile":"elife-14740-v2.xml","files":["elife-14740-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14740-v1.xml"]}
