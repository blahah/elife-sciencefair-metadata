However, in the clinic, <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status does not accurately predict cancer progression. Here we report, based on clinical analysis corroborated with experimental data, that the p53 isoform Δ133p53β promotes cancer cell invasion, regardless of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status. Δ133p53β increases risk of cancer recurrence and death in breast cancer patients. Furthermore Δ133p53β is critical to define invasiveness in a panel of breast and colon cell lines, expressing WT or mutant <italic>TP53</italic>. Endogenous mutant Δ133p53β depletion prevents invasiveness without affecting mutant full-length p53 protein expression. Mechanistically WT and mutant Δ133p53β induces EMT. Our findings provide explanations to 2 long-lasting and important clinical conundrums: how WT <italic>TP53</italic> can promote cancer cell invasion and reciprocally why mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene does not systematically induce cancer progression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14734"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14734"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14734","entryfile":"elife-14734-v3.xml","files":["elife-14734-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14734-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14734-v1.xml","elife-14734-v2.xml"]}
