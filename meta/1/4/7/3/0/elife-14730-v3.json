{"title":"Premature polyadenylation of <italic>MAGI3</italic> produces a dominantly-acting oncogene in human breast cancer","author":[{"surname":"Ni","given-names":"Thomas K"},{"surname":"Kuperwasser","given-names":"Charlotte"}],"abstract":"Genetic mutation, chromosomal rearrangement and copy number amplification are common mechanisms responsible for generating gain-of-function, cancer-causing alterations. Here we report a new mechanism by which premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA) of RNA can produce an oncogenic protein. We identify a pPA event at a cryptic intronic poly(A) signal in <italic>MAGI3</italic>, occurring in the absence of local exonic and intronic mutations. The altered mRNA isoform, called <italic>MAGI3</italic>, produces a truncated protein that acts in a dominant-negative manner to prevent full-length MAGI3 from interacting with the YAP oncoprotein, thereby relieving YAP inhibition and promoting malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. We additionally find evidence for recurrent expression of <italic>MAGI3 </italic>in primary human breast tumors but not in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Our results provide an example of how pPA contributes to cancer by generating a truncated mRNA isoform that encodes an oncogenic, gain-of-function protein.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14730"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14730"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14730","entryfile":"elife-14730-v3.xml","files":["elife-14730-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-14730-v1.xml","elife-14730-v2.xml"]}
