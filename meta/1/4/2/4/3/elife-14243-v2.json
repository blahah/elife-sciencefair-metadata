To understand the contribution of the transcription machinery in the disassembly of the +1 H2A.Z nucleosome, conditional mutants were used to block PIC assembly. A quantitative ChIP-seq approach, which allows detection of global occupancy change, was employed to measure H2A.Z occupancy. Blocking PIC assembly resulted in promoter-specific H2A.Z accumulation, indicating that the PIC is required to evict H2A.Z. By contrast, H2A.Z eviction was unaffected upon depletion of INO80, a remodeler previously reported to displace nucleosomal H2A.Z. Robust PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction was observed at active and infrequently transcribed genes, indicating that constitutive H2A.Z turnover is a general phenomenon. Finally, sites with strong H2A.Z turnover precisely mark transcript starts, providing a new metric for identifying cryptic and alternative sites of initiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14243"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14243"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14243","entryfile":"elife-14243-v2.xml","files":["elife-14243-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14243-v1.xml"]}
