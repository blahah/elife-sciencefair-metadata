{"title":"Murine Fam65b forms ring-like structures at the base of stereocilia critical for mechanosensory hair cell function","author":[{"surname":"Zhao","given-names":"Bo"},{"surname":"Wu","given-names":"Zizhen"},{"surname":"MÃ¼ller","given-names":"Ulrich"}],"abstract":"Cochlear hair cells convert sound-induced vibration into electrical signals. <italic>FAM65B</italic> mutations cause hearing loss by an unknown mechanism. Using biochemistry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we show here that Fam65b oligomers form a circumferential ring near the basal taper of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of murine hair cells. Taperin, a second protein near the taper, forms a dense-core-like structure that is disrupted in the absence of Fam65b. Stereocilia of <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient murine hair cells start to develop, but mechanotransduction is affected and stereocilia deteriorate. Yeast-two-hybrid screens identify RhoC as a Fam65b binding partner. RhoC co-localizes with Fam65b in stereocilia and regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Binding to RhoC and oligomerization are critical for Fam65b function. Our findings thus reveal a highly organized compartment near the base of stereocilia that is critical for hair cell function and affected in disease.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14222"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14222"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14222","entryfile":"elife-14222-v1.xml","files":["elife-14222-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-14222-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
