{"title":"NOVA regulates <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing during neuronal migration and axon guidance in the spinal cord","author":[{"surname":"Leggere","given-names":"Janelle C"},{"surname":"Saito","given-names":"Yuhki"},{"surname":"Darnell","given-names":"Robert B"},{"surname":"Tessier-Lavigne","given-names":"Marc"},{"surname":"Junge","given-names":"Harald J"},{"surname":"Chen","given-names":"Zhe"}],"abstract":"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control multiple aspects of post-transcriptional gene regulation and function during various biological processes in the nervous system. To further reveal the functional significance of RBPs during neural development, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural neurons. We found that the NOVA family of RBPs play a key role in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance. Interestingly, <italic>Nova</italic> mutants display similar defects as the knockout of the <italic>Dcc</italic> transmembrane receptor. We show here that <italic>Nova</italic> deficiency disrupts the alternative splicing of <italic>Dcc</italic>, and that restoring <italic>Dcc</italic> splicing in <italic>Nova</italic> knockouts is able to rescue the defects. Together, our results demonstrate that the production of DCC splice variants controlled by NOVA has a crucial function during many stages of commissural neuron development.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14264"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14264"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14264","entryfile":"elife-14264-v2.xml","files":["elife-14264-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14264-v1.xml"]}
