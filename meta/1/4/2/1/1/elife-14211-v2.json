{"title":"Synaptotagmin-1 C2B domain interacts simultaneously with SNAREs and membranes to promote membrane fusion","author":[{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Shen"},{"surname":"Li","given-names":"Yun"},{"surname":"Ma","given-names":"Cong"}],"abstract":"Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for neurotransmitter release through its C2 domains. It has been proposed that Syt1 promotes SNARE-dependent fusion mainly through its C2B domain, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the C2B domain interacts simultaneously with acidic membranes and SNARE complexes via the top Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops, the side polybasic patch, and the bottom face in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Disruption of the simultaneous interactions completely abrogates the triggering activity of the C2B domain in liposome fusion. We hypothesize that the simultaneous interactions endow the C2B domain with an ability to deform local membranes, and this membrane-deformation activity might underlie the functional significance of the Syt1 C2B domain in vivo.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14211"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14211"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14211","entryfile":"elife-14211-v2.xml","files":["elife-14211-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14211-v1.xml"]}
