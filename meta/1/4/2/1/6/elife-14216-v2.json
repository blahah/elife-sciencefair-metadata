Conserved fission yeast NDR (Nuclear Dbf2-Related) kinase Orb6 governs cell morphogenesis in part by spatially controlling Cdc42 GTPase. Here we describe a novel, independent function for Orb6 kinase in negatively regulating the recruitment of RNA-binding protein Sts5 into RNPs to promote polarized cell growth. We find that Orb6 kinase inhibits Sts5 recruitment into granules, its association with processing (P) bodies, and degradation of Sts5-bound mRNAs by promoting Sts5 interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24. Many Sts5-bound mRNAs encode essential factors for polarized cell growth, and Orb6 kinase spatially and temporally controls the extent of Sts5 granule formation. Disruption of this control system affects cell morphology and alters the pattern of polarized cell growth, revealing a role for Orb6 kinase in the spatial control of translational repression that enables normal cell morphogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14216"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14216"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14216","entryfile":"elife-14216-v2.xml","files":["elife-14216-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig8-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14216-v1.xml"]}
