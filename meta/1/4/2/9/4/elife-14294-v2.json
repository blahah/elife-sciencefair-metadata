RecJ, a member of DHH family proteins, is the only 5´ nuclease involved in the RecF recombination pathway. Here, we report the crystal structures of <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> RecJ in complex with deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), ssDNA, the C-terminal region of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB-Ct) and a mechanistic insight into the RecF pathway. A terminal 5´-phosphate-binding pocket above the active site determines the 5´-3´ polarity of the deoxy-exonuclease of RecJ; a helical gateway at the entrance to the active site admits ssDNA only; and the continuous stacking interactions between protein and nine nucleotides ensure the processive end resection. The active site of RecJ in the N-terminal domain contains two divalent cations that coordinate the nucleophilic water. The ssDNA makes a 180° turn at the scissile phosphate. The C-terminal domain of RecJ binds the SSB-Ct, which explains how RecJ and SSB work together to efficiently process broken DNA ends for homologous recombination.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"14294"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.14294"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"14294","entryfile":"elife-14294-v2.xml","files":["elife-14294-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-14294-v1.xml"]}
