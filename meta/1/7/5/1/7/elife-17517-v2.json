Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However, little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously, we identified that translational control by eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al., 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translation, cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover, selectively inhibiting eIF2α-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB, or knocking down <italic>oligophrenin-1</italic>—an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-eIF2α—in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively, our findings suggest that eIF2α-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17517"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17517"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17517","entryfile":"elife-17517-v2.xml","files":["elife-17517-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17517-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17517-v1.xml"]}
