{"title":"PTRF/Cavin-1 promotes efficient ribosomal RNA transcription in response to metabolic challenges","author":[{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Libin"},{"surname":"Pilch","given-names":"Paul F"}],"abstract":"Ribosomal RNA transcription mediated by RNA polymerase I represents the rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis. In eukaryotic cells, nutrients and growth factors regulate ribosomal RNA transcription through various key factors coupled to cell growth. We show here in mature adipocytes, ribosomal transcription can be acutely regulated in response to metabolic challenges. This acute response is mediated by PTRF (polymerase I transcription and release factor, also known as cavin-1), which has previously been shown to play a critical role in caveolae formation. The caveolaeâ€“independent rDNA transcriptional role of PTRF not only explains the lipodystrophy phenotype observed in PTRF deficient mice and humans, but also highlights its crucial physiological role in maintaining adipocyte allostasis. Multiple post-translational modifications of PTRF provide mechanistic bases for its regulation. The role of PTRF in ribosomal transcriptional efficiency is likely relevant to many additional physiological situations of cell growth and organismal metabolism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17508"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17508"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17508","entryfile":"elife-17508-v1.xml","files":["elife-17508-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17508-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
