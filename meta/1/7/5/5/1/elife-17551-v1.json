{"title":"Prostaglandin signaling regulates nephron segment patterning of renal progenitors during zebrafish kidney development","author":[{"surname":"Poureetezadi","given-names":"Shahram Jevin"},{"surname":"Cheng","given-names":"Christina N"},{"surname":"Chambers","given-names":"Joseph M"},{"surname":"Drummond","given-names":"Bridgette E"},{"surname":"Wingert","given-names":"Rebecca A"}],"abstract":"Kidney formation involves patterning events that induce renal progenitors to form nephrons with an intricate composition of multiple segments. Here, we performed a chemical genetic screen using zebrafish and discovered that prostaglandins, lipid mediators involved in many physiological functions, influenced pronephros segmentation. Modulating levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) or PGB<sub>2</sub> restricted distal segment formation and expanded a proximal segment lineage. Perturbation of prostaglandin synthesis by manipulating Cox1 or Cox2 activity altered distal segment formation and was rescued by exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. Disruption of the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors Ptger2a and Ptger4a similarly affected the distal segments. Further, changes in Cox activity or PGE<sub>2</sub> levels affected expression of the transcription factors <italic>irx3b</italic> and <italic>sim1a</italic> that mitigate pronephros segment patterning. These findings show for the first time that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a regulator of nephron formation in the zebrafish embryonic kidney, thus revealing that prostaglandin signaling may have implications for renal birth defects and other diseases.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17551"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17551"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17551","entryfile":"elife-17551-v1.xml","files":["elife-17551-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17551-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
