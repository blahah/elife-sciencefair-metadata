The centriolar protein Cp110 is a regulator of this process and cilia inhibitor, but its positive roles in ciliogenesis remain poorly understood. Using <italic>Xenopus</italic> we show that Cp110 inhibits cilia formation at high levels, while optimal levels promote ciliogenesis. Cp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodies and rootlets, and is required for ciliary adhesion complexes that facilitate Actin interactions. The opposing roles of Cp110 in ciliation are generated in part by coiled-coil domains that mediate preferential binding to centrioles over rootlets. Because of its dual role in ciliogenesis, Cp110 levels must be precisely controlled. In multiciliated cells, this is achieved by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation through ciliary transcription factors and microRNAs, which activate and repress <italic>cp110</italic> to produce optimal Cp110 levels during ciliogenesis. Our data provide novel insights into how Cp110 and its regulation contribute to development and cell function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17557"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17557"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17557","entryfile":"elife-17557-v2.xml","files":["elife-17557-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17557-v1.xml"]}
