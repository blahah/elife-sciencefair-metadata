Live imaging at stage 9 reveals that <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA particles undergo rapid Dynein-dependent movements near the oocyte anterior, but with no directional bias. Furthermore, <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA localises normally in <italic>shot</italic>, which abolishes the polarised microtubule organisation. FRAP and photo-conversion experiments demonstrate that the RNA is stably anchored at the anterior, independently of microtubules. Thus, <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA is localised by random active transport and anterior anchoring. Super-resolution imaging reveals that <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA forms 110–120 nm particles with variable RNA content, but constant size. These particles appear to be well-defined structures that package the RNA for transport and anchoring.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17537"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17537"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17537","entryfile":"elife-17537-v4.xml","files":["elife-17537-fig1-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig4-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig7-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-fig9-v4-600w.jpg","elife-17537-v1.xml","elife-17537-v2.xml","elife-17537-v3.xml"]}
