E2 also has links to genomic instability, and elevated E2 levels are tied to breast cancer. Here, we show that E2 stimulation causes a rapid, global increase in the formation of R-loops, co-transcriptional RNA-DNA products, which in some instances have been linked to DNA damage. We show that E2-dependent R-loop formation and breast cancer rearrangements are highly enriched at E2-responsive genomic loci and that E2 induces DNA replication-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs). Strikingly, many DSBs that accumulate in response to E2 are R-loop dependent. Thus, R-loops resulting from the E2 transcriptional response are a significant source of DNA damage. This work reveals a novel mechanism by which E2 stimulation leads to genomic instability and highlights how transcriptional programs play an important role in shaping the genomic landscape of DNA damage susceptibility.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17548"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17548"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17548","entryfile":"elife-17548-v2.xml","files":["elife-17548-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17548-v1.xml"]}
