However, little is known regarding the potential components involved in the regulation of bimodal behavioral rhythms in mammals. Here, we identified that the zinc finger protein gene <italic>Zbtb20</italic> plays a crucial role in the regulation of bimodal activities in mice. Depletion of <italic>Zbtb20</italic> in nerve system resulted in the loss of early evening activity, but the increase of morning activity. We found that <italic>Zbtb20</italic>-deficient mice exhibited a pronounced decrease in the expression of <italic>Prokr2</italic> and resembled phenotypes of <italic>Prok2</italic> and <italic>Prokr2</italic>-knockout mice. Injection of adeno-associated virus-double-floxed <italic>Prokr2</italic> in suprachiasmatic nucleus could partly restore evening activity in <italic>Nestin-Cre; Zbtb20</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> (NS-ZB20KO) mice. Furthermore, loss of <italic>Zbtb20</italic> in <italic>Foxg1</italic> loci, but intact in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was not responsible for the unimodal activity of NS-ZB20KO mice. Our study provides evidence that ZBTB20-mediated PROKR2 signaling is critical for the evening behavioral rhythms.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17171"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17171"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17171","entryfile":"elife-17171-v1.xml","files":["elife-17171-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17171-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
