Here, we identify <italic>QIL1</italic> null alleles in two siblings displaying multiple clinical symptoms of early-onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy with liver disease, including defects in respiratory chain function in patient muscle. QIL1 absence in patients’ fibroblasts was associated with MICOS disassembly, abnormal cristae, mild cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase defect, and sensitivity to glucose withdrawal. QIL1 expression rescued cristae defects, and promoted re-accumulation of MICOS subunits to facilitate MICOS assembly. MICOS assembly and cristae morphology were not efficiently rescued by over-expression of other MICOS subunits in patient fibroblasts. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence of altered MICOS assembly linked with a human mitochondrial disease and confirm a central role for QIL1 in stable MICOS complex formation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17163"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17163"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17163","entryfile":"elife-17163-v1.xml","files":["elife-17163-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17163-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17163-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17163-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17163-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17163-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
