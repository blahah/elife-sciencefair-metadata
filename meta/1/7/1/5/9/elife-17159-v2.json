To date, the mechanisms of KCNQ channel modulation have been mostly characterized to be inhibitory via Gq-coupled receptors, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and protein kinase C. Here we demonstrate that methylation of KCNQ by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (Prmt1) positively regulates KCNQ channel activity, thereby preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. <italic>Prmt1+/-</italic> mice exhibit epileptic seizures. Methylation of KCNQ2 channels at 4 arginine residues by Prmt1 enhances PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, and <italic>Prmt1</italic> depletion lowers PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of KCNQ2 channels and thereby the channel activities. Consistently, exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> addition to <italic>Prmt1+/-</italic> neurons restores KCNQ currents and neuronal excitability to the WT level. Collectively, we propose that Prmt1-dependent facilitation of KCNQ-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction underlies the positive regulation of KCNQ activity by arginine methylation, which may serve as a key target for prevention of neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17159"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17159"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17159","entryfile":"elife-17159-v2.xml","files":["elife-17159-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig5-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig7-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17159-v1.xml"]}
