How the initial contractions are established and the downstream consequences of the earliest contractile function on cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis have not been described. Using high-resolution live imaging of mouse embryos, we observed randomly distributed spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations (SACOs) in the forming cardiac crescent (stage E7.75) prior to overt beating. Nascent contraction initiated at around E8.0 and was associated with sarcomeric assembly and rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, underpinned by sequential expression of the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX1) and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC). Pharmacological inhibition of NCX1 and LTCC revealed rapid development of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the early heart and an essential early role for NCX1 in establishing SACOs through to the initiation of beating. NCX1 blockade impacted on CaMKII signalling to down-regulate cardiac gene expression, leading to impaired differentiation and failed crescent maturation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17113"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17113"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17113","entryfile":"elife-17113-v1.xml","files":["elife-17113-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17113-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
