However, to date, no clinically relevant inhibitor of this cascade has been tested in experimental models of addiction, a necessary step toward clinical trials. We designed two new cell-penetrating peptides - RB1 and RB3 - that penetrate the brain and, in the micromolar range, inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, histone H3 and S6 ribosomal protein in striatal slices. Furthermore, a screening of small therapeutics currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy revealed PD325901 as a brain-penetrating drug that blocks ERK signalling in the nanomolar range. All three compounds have an inhibitory effect on cocaine-induced ERK activation and reward in mice. In particular, PD325901 persistently blocks cocaine-induced place preference and accelerates extinction following cocaine self-administration. Thus, clinically relevant, systemically administered drugs that attenuate Ras-ERK signalling in the brain may be valuable tools for the treatment of cocaine addiction.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17111"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17111"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17111","entryfile":"elife-17111-v2.xml","files":["elife-17111-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17111-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17111-v1.xml"]}
