The axon/myelin-unit becomes impaired in myelin-related disorders and upon normal aging. However, the molecular cause of many pathological features, including the frequently observed myelin outfoldings, remained unknown. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we find that the presence of myelin outfoldings correlates with a loss of cytoskeletal septins in myelin. Regulated by phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>)-levels, myelin septins (SEPT2/SEPT4/SEPT7/SEPT8) and the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-adaptor anillin form previously unrecognized filaments that extend longitudinally along myelinated axons. By confocal microscopy and immunogold-electron microscopy, these filaments are localized to the non-compacted adaxonal myelin compartment. Genetic disruption of these filaments in <italic>Sept8</italic>-mutant mice causes myelin outfoldings as a very specific neuropathology. Septin filaments thus serve an important function in scaffolding the axon/myelin-unit, evidently a late stage of myelin maturation. We propose that pathological or aging-associated diminishment of the septin/anillin-scaffold causes myelin outfoldings that impair the normal nerve conduction velocity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17119"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17119"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17119","entryfile":"elife-17119-v1.xml","files":["elife-17119-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17119-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
