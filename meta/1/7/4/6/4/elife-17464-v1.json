{"title":"Hippocampal neurogenesis enhancers promote forgetting of remote fear memory after hippocampal reactivation by retrieval","author":[{"surname":"Ishikawa","given-names":"Rie"},{"surname":"Fukushima","given-names":"Hotaka"},{"surname":"Frankland","given-names":"Paul W"},{"surname":"Kida","given-names":"Satoshi"}],"abstract":"Forgetting of recent fear memory is promoted by treatment with memantine (MEM), which increases hippocampal neurogenesis. The approaches for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using rodent models have focused on the extinction and reconsolidation of recent, but not remote, memories. Here we show that, following prolonged re-exposure to the conditioning context, enhancers of hippocampal neurogenesis, including MEM, promote forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. However, these interventions are ineffective following shorter re-exposures. Importantly, we find that long, but not short re-exposures activate gene expression in the hippocampus and induce hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory. Furthermore, remote memory retrieval becomes hippocampus-dependent after the long-time recall, suggesting that remote fear memory returns to a hippocampus dependent state after the long-time recall, thereby allowing enhanced forgetting by increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Forgetting of traumatic memory may contribute to the development of PTSD treatment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17464"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17464"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17464","entryfile":"elife-17464-v1.xml","files":["elife-17464-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17464-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17464-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17464-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17464-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17464-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17464-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
