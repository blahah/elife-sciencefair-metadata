{"title":"The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates focal adhesions at the leading edge of migrating cells","author":[{"surname":"Teckchandani","given-names":"Anjali"},{"surname":"Cooper","given-names":"Jonathan A"}],"abstract":"Cell migration requires the cyclical assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions. Adhesion induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, including Cas (Crk-associated substrate/p130Cas/BCAR1). However, Cas phosphorylation stimulates adhesion turnover. This raises the question of how adhesion assembly occurs against opposition from phospho-Cas. Here we show that suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS6) and Cullin 5, two components of the CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> ubiquitin ligase, inhibit Cas-dependent focal adhesion turnover at the front but not rear of migrating epithelial cells. The front focal adhesions contain phospho-Cas which recruits SOCS6. If SOCS6 cannot access focal adhesions, or if cullins or the proteasome are inhibited, adhesion disassembly is stimulated. This suggests that the localized targeting of phospho-Cas within adhesions by CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> and concurrent cullin and proteasome activity provide a negative feedback loop, ensuring that adhesion assembly predominates over disassembly at the leading edge. By this mechanism, ubiquitination provides a new level of spatio-temporal control over cell migration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17440"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17440"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17440","entryfile":"elife-17440-v2.xml","files":["elife-17440-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17440-v1.xml"]}
