{"title":"Valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) inhibitors relieve Mitofusin-dependent mitochondrial defects due to VCP disease mutants","author":[{"surname":"Zhang","given-names":"Ting"},{"surname":"Mishra","given-names":"Prashant"},{"surname":"Hay","given-names":"Bruce A"},{"surname":"Chan","given-names":"David"},{"surname":"Guo","given-names":"Ming"}],"abstract":"Missense mutations of <italic>valosin-containing protein</italic> (<italic>VCP</italic>) cause an autosomal dominant disease known as inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease with frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. The pathological mechanism of IBMPFD is not clear and there is no treatment. We show that endogenous VCP negatively regulates Mitofusin, which is required for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion. Because 90% of IBMPFD patients have myopathy, we generated an <italic>in vivo</italic> IBMPFD model in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle, which recapitulates disease pathologies. We show that common VCP disease mutants act as hyperactive alleles with respect to regulation of Mitofusin. Importantly, VCP inhibitors suppress mitochondrial defects, muscle tissue damage and cell death associated with IBMPFD models in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These inhibitors also suppress mitochondrial fusion and respiratory defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts. These results suggest that VCP disease mutants cause IBMPFD through a gain-of-function mechanism, and that VCP inhibitors have therapeutic value.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17834"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17834"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17834","entryfile":"elife-17834-v2.xml","files":["elife-17834-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17834-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17834-v1.xml"]}
