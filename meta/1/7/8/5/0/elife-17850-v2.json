Thus, in preparation for a first-in-human trial of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for septic shock, we applied systematic review methodology to evaluate all published preclinical evidence. We identified 20 controlled comparison experiments (980 animals from 18 publications) of <italic>in vivo</italic> sepsis models. Meta-analysis demonstrated that MSC treatment of preclinical sepsis significantly reduced mortality over a range of experimental conditions (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.18â€“0.40, latest timepoint reported for each study). Risk of bias was unclear as few studies described elements such as randomization and no studies included an appropriately calculated sample size. Moreover, the presence of publication bias resulted in a ~30% overestimate of effect and threats to validity limit the strength of our conclusions. This novel prospective application of systematic review methodology serves as a template to evaluate preclinical evidence prior to initiating first-in-human clinical studies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17850"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17850"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17850","entryfile":"elife-17850-v2.xml","files":["elife-17850-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17850-v1.xml"]}
