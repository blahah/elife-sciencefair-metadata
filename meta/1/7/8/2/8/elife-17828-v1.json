In this study, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP), which has a well-known role in FASII, plays an unexpected and evolutionarily conserved role in FeS biogenesis. ACP is a stable and essential subunit of the eukaryotic FeS biogenesis complex. In the absence of ACP, the complex is destabilized resulting in a profound depletion of FeS throughout the cell. This role of ACP depends upon its covalently bound 4â€™-phosphopantetheine (4-PP)-conjugated acyl chain to support maximal cysteine desulfurase activity. Thus, it is likely that ACP is not simply an obligate subunit but also exploits the 4-PP-conjugated acyl chain to coordinate mitochondrial fatty acid and FeS biogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17828"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17828"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17828","entryfile":"elife-17828-v1.xml","files":["elife-17828-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17828-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
