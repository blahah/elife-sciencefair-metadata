The prevailing view is that MDSC-mediated immunosuppression is restricted to tissues where MDSC co-mingle with T cells. Here we show that splenic or, unexpectedly, blood-borne MDSC execute far-reaching immune suppression by reducing expression of the L-selectin lymph node (LN) homing receptor on na√Øve T and B cells. MDSC-induced L-selectin loss occurs through a contact-dependent, post-transcriptional mechanism that is independent of the major L-selectin sheddase, ADAM17, but results in significant elevation of circulating L-selectin in tumor-bearing mice. Even moderate deficits in L-selectin expression disrupt T cell trafficking to distant LN. Furthermore, T cells preconditioned by MDSC have diminished responses to subsequent antigen exposure, which in conjunction with reduced trafficking, severely restricts antigen-driven expansion in widely-dispersed LN. These results establish novel mechanisms for MDSC-mediated immunosuppression that have unanticipated implications for systemic cancer immunity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17375"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17375"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17375","entryfile":"elife-17375-v2.xml","files":["elife-17375-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17375-v1.xml"]}
