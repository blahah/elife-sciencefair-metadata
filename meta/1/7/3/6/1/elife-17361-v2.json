In the adult brain Satb2 is almost exclusively expressed in pyramidal neurons of two brain regions important for memory formation, the cerebral cortex and the CA1-hippocampal field. Here we show that Satb2 is required for key hippocampal functions since deletion of Satb2 from the adult mouse forebrain prevents the stabilization of synaptic long-term potentiation and markedly impairs long-term fear and object discrimination memory. At the molecular level, we find that synaptic activity and BDNF up-regulate Satb2, which itself binds to the promoters of coding and non-coding genes. Satb2 controls the hippocampal levels of a large cohort of miRNAs, many of which are implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Together, our findings demonstrate that Satb2 is critically involved in long-term plasticity processes in the adult forebrain that underlie the consolidation and stabilization of context-linked memory.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17361"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17361"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17361","entryfile":"elife-17361-v2.xml","files":["elife-17361-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17361-v1.xml"]}
