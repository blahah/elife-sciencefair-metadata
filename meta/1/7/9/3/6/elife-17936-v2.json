We report here that mTOR in CD4 T cells is essential for Tfh differentiation. In <italic>Mtor-Cd4Cre</italic> mice, both constitutive and inducible Tfh differentiation is severely impaired, leading to defective germinal center B cell formation and antibody production. Moreover, both mTORC1 and mTORC2 contribute to Tfh and GC B cell development but may do so via distinct mechanisms. mTORC1 mainly promotes CD4 T cell proliferation to reach the cell divisions necessary for Tfh differentiation, while Rictor/mTORC2 regulates Tfh differentiation by promoting Akt activation and TCF1 expression without grossly influencing T cell proliferation. Together, our results reveal crucial but distinct roles for mTORC1 and mTORC2 in CD4 T cells during Tfh differentiation and germinal center responses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17936"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17936"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17936","entryfile":"elife-17936-v2.xml","files":["elife-17936-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17936-v1.xml"]}
