We showed previously that SMOC inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling downstream of its receptor via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In contrast, the most prominent effect of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue, <italic>pentagone</italic> (<italic>pent</italic>), is expanding the range of BMP signaling during wing patterning. Using SMOC deletion constructs we found that SMOC-âˆ†EC, lacking the extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain, inhibited BMP2 signaling, whereas SMOC-EC (EC domain only) enhanced BMP2 signaling. The SMOC-EC domain bound HSPGs with a similar affinity to BMP2 and could expand the range of BMP signaling in an in vitro assay by competition for HSPG-binding. Together with data from studies in vivo we propose a model to explain how these two activities contribute to the function of Pent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development and SMOC in mammalian joint formation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17935"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17935"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"17935","entryfile":"elife-17935-v1.xml","files":["elife-17935-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17935-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
