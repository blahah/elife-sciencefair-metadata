We now describe an unexpected role of Pask in promoting the differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells and adipogenic progenitor cells. This function of Pask is dependent upon its ability to phosphorylate Wdr5, a member of several protein complexes including those that catalyze histone H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during transcriptional activation. Our findings suggest that, during myoblast differentiation, Pask stimulates the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 to activating H3K4me3 marks on the promoter of the differentiation gene myogenin (<italic>Myog</italic>) via Wdr5 phosphorylation. This enhances accessibility of the MyoD transcription factor and enables transcriptional activation of the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter to initiate muscle differentiation. Thus, as an upstream kinase of Wdr5, Pask integrates signaling cues with the transcriptional network to regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17985"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17985"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17985","entryfile":"elife-17985-v2.xml","files":["elife-17985-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17985-resp-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17985-v1.xml"]}
