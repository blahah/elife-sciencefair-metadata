In <italic>Primula</italic> (primroses), heterostyly is controlled by the <italic>S</italic>-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we identify the <italic>Primula CYP734A50</italic> gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the <italic>G</italic> locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. <italic>CYP734A50</italic> is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, it is specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the <italic>Primula</italic> style-length dimorphism and begin to shed light on the evolution of the <italic>S</italic>-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17956"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17956"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17956","entryfile":"elife-17956-v1.xml","files":["elife-17956-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17956-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
