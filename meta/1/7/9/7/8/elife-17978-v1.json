{"title":"A common bacterial metabolite elicits prion-based bypass of glucose repression","author":[{"surname":"Garcia","given-names":"David M"},{"surname":"Dietrich","given-names":"David"},{"surname":"Clardy","given-names":"Jon"},{"surname":"Jarosz","given-names":"Daniel F"}],"abstract":"Robust preference for fermentative glucose metabolism has motivated domestication of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. This program can be circumvented by a protein-based genetic element, the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion, permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources. Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>], although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] inducer. Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression. This trait had the defining genetic properties of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>], and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source. Lactic acid also induced [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ~200 million years ago, and in which glucose repression evolved independently. To our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17978"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17978"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17978","entryfile":"elife-17978-v1.xml","files":["elife-17978-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17978-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
