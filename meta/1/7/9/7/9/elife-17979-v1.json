While dendritic cells (DCs) are important for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell priming, how this process is regulated in vivo is unclear. We show here that the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs specifically enhanced the development of Tfh cells, germinal center B cells and antibody responses against protein antigens. Exaggerated antibody responses in mice depleted of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs occurred in the absence of any adjuvants, and resulting antibodies had broader specificity and higher affinity to the immunogen. CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs express high levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 during priming in wild-type mice partially mimicked the phenotype of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted animals, suggesting their role in Tfh suppression. Transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC results in the generation of autoreactive IgG responses. These results revealed a novel regulatory mechanism and a key role of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs in blocking autoantibody generation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17979"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17979"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17979","entryfile":"elife-17979-v1.xml","files":["elife-17979-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig10-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17979-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
