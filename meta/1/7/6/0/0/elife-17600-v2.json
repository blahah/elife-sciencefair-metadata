TRPM2 is activated by ADP ribose (ADPR) binding to its C-terminal cytosolic NUDT9-homology (NUDT9H) domain, homologous to the soluble mitochondrial ADPR pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) NUDT9. Reported ADPR hydrolysis classified TRPM2 as a channel-enzyme, but insolubility of isolated NUDT9H hampered further investigations. Here we developed a soluble NUDT9H model using chimeric proteins built from complementary polypeptide fragments of NUDT9H and NUDT9. When expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, chimeras containing up to ~90% NUDT9H sequence remained soluble and were affinity-purified. In ADPRase assays the conserved <italic>Nudix-box</italic> sequence of NUDT9 proved essential for activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>~4-9s<sup>-1</sup>), that of NUDT9H did not support catalysis. Replacing NUDT9H in full-length TRPM2 with soluble chimeras retained ADPR-dependent channel gating (K<sub>1/2</sub>~1-5 μM), confirming functionality of chimeric domains. Thus, TRPM2 is not a 'chanzyme'. Chimeras provide convenient soluble NUDT9H models for structural/biochemical studies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17600"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17600"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17600","entryfile":"elife-17600-v2.xml","files":["elife-17600-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17600-v1.xml"]}
