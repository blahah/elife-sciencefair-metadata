Targeting of PRC1 to chromatin is thought to be mediated by the Cbx family proteins (Cbx2/4/6/7/8) binding to histone H3 with a K27me3 modification (H3K27me3). Despite this prevailing view, the molecular mechanisms of targeting remain poorly understood. Here, by combining live-cell single-molecule tracking (SMT) and genetic engineering, we reveal that H3K27me3 contributes significantly to the targeting of Cbx7 and Cbx8 to chromatin, but less to Cbx2, Cbx4, and Cbx6. Genetic disruption of the complex formation of PRC1 facilitates the targeting of Cbx7 to chromatin. Biochemical analyses uncover that the CD and AT-hook-like (ATL) motif of Cbx7 constitute a functional DNA-binding unit. Live-cell SMT of Cbx7 mutants demonstrates that Cbx7 is targeted to chromatin by co-recognizing of H3K27me3 and DNA. Our data suggest a novel hierarchical cooperation mechanism by which histone modifications and DNA coordinate to target chromatin regulatory complexes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17667"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17667"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17667","entryfile":"elife-17667-v1.xml","files":["elife-17667-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17667-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
