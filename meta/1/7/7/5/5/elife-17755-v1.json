Here we report a near atomic structure of the active human apoptosome determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting model gives insights into cytochrome c binding, nucleotide exchange and conformational changes that drive assembly. During activation an acentric disk is formed on the central hub of the apoptosome. This disk contains four Apaf-1/pc-9 CARD pairs arranged in a shallow spiral with the fourth pc-9 CARD at lower occupancy. On average, Apaf-1 CARDs recruit 3 to 5 pc-9 molecules to the apoptosome and one catalytic domain may be parked on the hub, when an odd number of zymogens are bound. This suggests a stoichiometry of one or at most, two pc-9 dimers per active apoptosome. Thus, our structure provides a molecular framework to understand the role of the apoptosome in programmed cell death and disease.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17755"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17755"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17755","entryfile":"elife-17755-v1.xml","files":["elife-17755-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17755-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
