Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the cortex to store coherent and integrated memories.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17267"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17267"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17267","entryfile":"elife-17267-v1.xml","files":["elife-17267-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17267-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
