The Wg/Wnt morphogen reception is essential for signal activation, whose activity is mediated through the receptor complex and a scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dsh). We report here that the exon junction complex (EJC) activity is indispensable for Wg signaling by maintaining an appropriate level of Dsh protein for Wg ligand reception in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Transcriptome analyses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs indicate that the EJC controls the splicing of the cell polarity gene <italic>discs large 1 (dlg1</italic>), whose coding protein directly interacts with Dsh. Genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrate that Dlg1 protein acts independently from its role in cell polarity to protect Dsh protein from lysosomal degradation. More importantly, human orthologous Dlg protein is sufficient to promote Dvl protein stabilization and Wnt signaling activity, thus revealing a conserved regulatory mechanism of Wg/Wnt signaling by Dlg and EJC.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17200"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17200"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17200","entryfile":"elife-17200-v2.xml","files":["elife-17200-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig4-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17200-v1.xml"]}
