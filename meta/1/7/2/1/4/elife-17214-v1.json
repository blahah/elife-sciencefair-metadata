The regulation of leaf senescence is a complex process. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a novel and the pivotal role of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HDA9 (a RPD3-like histone deacetylase) in promoting the onset of leaf senescence. We found that HDA9 acts in complex with a SANT domain-containing protein POWERDRESS (PWR) and transcription factor WRKY53. Our genome-wide profiling of HDA9 occupancy reveals that HDA9 directly binds to the promoters of key negative regulators of senescence and this association requires PWR. Furthermore, we found that PWR is important for HDA9 nuclear accumulation. This study reveals an uncharacterized epigenetic complex involved in leaf senescence and provides mechanistic insights into how a histone deacetylase along with a chromatin-binding protein contribute to a robust regulatory network to modulate the onset of plant aging.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17214"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17214"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17214","entryfile":"elife-17214-v1.xml","files":["elife-17214-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17214-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
