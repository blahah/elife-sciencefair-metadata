{"title":"Resolving coiled shapes reveals new reorientation behaviors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Broekmans","given-names":"Onno D"},{"surname":"Rodgers","given-names":"Jarlath B"},{"surname":"Ryu","given-names":"William S"},{"surname":"Stephens","given-names":"Greg J"}],"abstract":"We exploit the reduced space of <italic>C. elegans</italic> postures to develop a novel tracking algorithm which captures both simple shapes and also self-occluding coils, an important, yet unexplored, component of 2D worm behavior. We apply our algorithm to show that visually complex, coiled sequences are a superposition of two simpler patterns: the body wave dynamics and a head-curvature pulse. We demonstrate the precise <inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula>-turn dynamics of an escape response and uncover a surprising new dichotomy in spontaneous, large-amplitude coils; deep reorientations occur not only through classical <inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula>-shaped postures but also through larger postural excitations which we label here as <inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula>-turns. We find that omega and delta turns occur independently, suggesting a distinct triggering mechanism, and are the serpentine analog of a random left-right step. Finally, we show that omega and delta turns occur with approximately equal rates and adapt to food-free conditions on a similar timescale, a simple strategy to avoid navigational bias.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17227"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17227"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17227","entryfile":"elife-17227-v2.xml","files":["elife-17227-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17227-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17227-v1.xml"]}
