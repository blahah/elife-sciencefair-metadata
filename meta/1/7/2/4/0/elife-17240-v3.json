Here we show that AITC (allyl isothiocyanate; mustard oil) and menthol represent two distinct types of ligands at the mammalian cold sensor TRPM8. Kinetic analysis of channel gating revealed that AITC acts by destabilizing the closed channel, whereas menthol stabilizes the open channel, relative to the transition state. Based on these differences, we classify agonists as either type I (menthol-like) or type II (AITC-like), and provide a kinetic model that faithfully reproduces their differential effects. We further demonstrate that type I and type II agonists have a distinct impact on TRPM8 currents and TRPM8-mediated calcium signals in excitable cells. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the differential actions of TRP channel ligands, with important ramifications for TRP channel structure-function analysis and pharmacology.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17240"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17240"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17240","entryfile":"elife-17240-v3.xml","files":["elife-17240-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17240-v1.xml","elife-17240-v2.xml"]}
