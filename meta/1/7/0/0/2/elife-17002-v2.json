{"title":"A functional genomics screen in planarians reveals regulators of whole-brain regeneration","author":[{"surname":"Roberts-Galbraith","given-names":"Rachel H"},{"surname":"Brubacher","given-names":"John L"},{"surname":"Newmark","given-names":"Phillip A"}],"abstract":"Planarians regenerate all body parts after injury, including the central nervous system (CNS). We capitalized on this distinctive trait and completed a gene expression-guided functional screen to identify factors that regulate diverse aspects of neural regeneration in <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. Our screen revealed molecules that influence neural cell fates, support the formation of a major connective hub, and promote reestablishment of chemosensory behavior. We also identified genes that encode signaling molecules with roles in head regeneration, including some that are produced in a previously uncharacterized parenchymal population of cells. Finally, we explored genes downregulated during planarian regeneration and characterized, for the first time, glial cells in the planarian CNS that respond to injury by repressing several transcripts. Collectively, our studies revealed diverse molecules and cell types that underlie an animalâ€™s ability to regenerate its brain.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17002"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17002"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17002","entryfile":"elife-17002-v2.xml","files":["elife-17002-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17002-v1.xml"]}
