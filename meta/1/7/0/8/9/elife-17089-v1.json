{"title":"Grid-cell representations in mental simulation","author":[{"surname":"Bellmund","given-names":"Jacob LS"},{"surname":"Deuker","given-names":"Lorena"},{"surname":"Navarro Schröder","given-names":"Tobias"},{"surname":"Doeller","given-names":"Christian F"}],"abstract":"Anticipating the future is a key motif of the brain, possibly supported by mental simulation of upcoming events. Rodent single-cell recordings suggest the ability of spatially tuned cells to represent subsequent locations. Grid-like representations have been observed in the human entorhinal cortex during virtual and imagined navigation. However, hitherto it remains unknown if grid-like representations contribute to mental simulation in the absence of imagined movement. Participants imagined directions between building locations in a large-scale virtual-reality city while undergoing fMRI without re-exposure to the environment. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we provide evidence for representations of absolute imagined direction at a resolution of 30° in the parahippocampal gyrus, consistent with the head-direction system. Furthermore, we capitalize on the six-fold rotational symmetry of grid-cell firing to demonstrate a 60° periodic pattern-similarity structure in the entorhinal cortex. Our findings imply a role of the entorhinal grid-system in mental simulation and future thinking beyond spatial navigation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17089"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17089"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17089","entryfile":"elife-17089-v1.xml","files":["elife-17089-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17089-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
