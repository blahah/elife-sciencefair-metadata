We investigated combinatorial translational regulation by <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos), which control development, fertility, and neuronal functions. Our results show how the specificity of one RBP (Pum) is modulated by cooperative RNA recognition with a second RBP (Nos) to synergistically repress mRNAs. Crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes reveal that Nos embraces Pum and RNA, contributes sequence-specific contacts, and increases Pum RNA-binding affinity. Nos shifts the recognition sequence and promotes repression complex formation on mRNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone, explaining the preponderance of sub-optimal Pum sites regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of a regulatory switch controlling crucial gene expression programs, and provide a framework for understanding how the partnering of RBPs evokes changes in binding specificity that underlie regulatory network dynamics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17096"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17096"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"17096","entryfile":"elife-17096-v2.xml","files":["elife-17096-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig6-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17096-v1.xml"]}
