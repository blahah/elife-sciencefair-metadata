As part of such adaptation they maintain an active memory of heat stress for several days that promotes a more efficient response to recurring stress. We show that this heat stress memory requires the activity of the <italic>FORGETTER1 (FGT1</italic>) locus, with <italic>fgt1</italic> mutants displaying reduced maintenance of heat-induced gene expression. <italic>FGT1</italic> encodes the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> orthologue of Strawberry notch (Sno), and the protein globally associates with the promoter regions of actively expressed genes in a heat-dependent fashion. FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF and ISWI families, which also display reduced heat stress memory. Genomic targets of the BRM remodeler overlap significantly with FGT1 targets. Accordingly, nucleosome dynamics at loci with altered maintenance of heat-induced expression are affected in <italic>fgt1</italic>. Together, our results suggest that by modulating nucleosome occupancy, FGT1 mediates stress-induced chromatin memory.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17061"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17061"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17061","entryfile":"elife-17061-v1.xml","files":["elife-17061-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17061-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
