HIV-1 contains an assembly and maturation switch that spans the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the capsid (CA) region and the first spacer peptide (SP1) of the precursor structural protein, Gag. The crystal structure of the CTD-SP1 Gag fragment is a goblet-shaped hexamer in which the cup comprises the CTD and an ensuing type II β-turn, and the stem comprises a 6-helix bundle. The β-turn is critical for immature virus assembly and the 6-helix bundle regulates proteolysis during maturation. This bipartite character explains why the SP1 spacer is a critical element of HIV-1 Gag but is not a universal property of retroviruses. Our results also indicate that HIV-1 maturation inhibitors suppress unfolding of the CA-SP1 junction and thereby delay access of the viral protease to its substrate.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17063"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17063"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17063","entryfile":"elife-17063-v3.xml","files":["elife-17063-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17063-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-17063-v1.xml","elife-17063-v2.xml"]}
