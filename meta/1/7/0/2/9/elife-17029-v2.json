RelA/SpoT-homolog proteins synthesize transcriptional modulators (p)ppGpp, allowing bacteria to adapt to stress. RelA is activated during amino-acid starvation, when cognate deacyl-tRNA binds to the ribosomal A (aminoacyl-tRNA) site. We report four cryo-EM structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> RelA bound to the 70S ribosome, in the absence and presence of deacyl-tRNA accommodating in the 30S A site. The boomerang-shaped RelA with a wingspan of more than 100 Å wraps around the A/R (30S <underline>A</underline>-site/<underline>R</underline>elA-bound) tRNA. The CCA end of the A/R tRNA pins the central TGS domain against the 30S subunit, presenting the (p)ppGpp-synthetase domain near the 30S spur. The ribosome and A/R tRNA are captured in three conformations, revealing hitherto elusive states of tRNA engagement with the ribosomal decoding center. Decoding-center rearrangements are coupled with the step-wise 30S-subunit 'closure', providing insights into the dynamics of high-fidelity tRNA decoding.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17029"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17029"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17029","entryfile":"elife-17029-v2.xml","files":["elife-17029-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-17029-v1.xml"]}
