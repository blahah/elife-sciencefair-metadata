The mechanisms leading to kidney tumor development remain uncharacterized and effective therapies are yet to be identified. Hence, the need to model these diseases in an experimental animal system (<xref>Kauffman et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that kidney-specific <italic>TFEB</italic> overexpression in transgenic mice, resulted in renal clear cells, multi-layered basement membranes, severe cystic pathology, and ultimately papillary carcinomas with hepatic metastases. These features closely recapitulate those observed in both <italic>TFEB-</italic> and <italic>TFE3</italic>-mediated human kidney tumors. Analysis of kidney samples revealed transcriptional induction and enhanced signaling of the WNT β-catenin pathway. WNT signaling inhibitors normalized the proliferation rate of primary kidney cells and significantly rescued the disease phenotype in vivo. These data shed new light on the mechanisms underlying <italic>TFE-</italic>fusion <italic>RCCs</italic> and suggest a possible therapeutic strategy based on the inhibition of the WNT pathway.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"17047"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.17047"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"17047","entryfile":"elife-17047-v1.xml","files":["elife-17047-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-17047-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
