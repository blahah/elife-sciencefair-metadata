Although linked to several pathways including cell survival and metabolism, the molecular mechanisms underlying these outcomes are poorly understood. We identified a novel interaction of DPP9 with Filamin A, which recruits DPP9 to Syk, a central kinase in B-cell signalling. Syk signalling can be terminated by degradation, requiring the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl. We show that DPP9 cleaves Syk to produce a neo N-terminus with serine in position 1. Pulse-chases combined with mutagenesis studies reveal that Ser1 strongly influences Syk stability. Furthermore, DPP9 silencing reduces Cbl interaction with Syk, suggesting that DPP9 processing is a prerequisite for Syk ubiquitination. Consistently, DPP9 inhibition stabilizes Syk, thereby modulating Syk signalling. Taken together, we demonstrate DPP9 as a negative regulator of Syk and conclude that DPP9 is a novel integral aminopeptidase of the N-end rule pathway.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16370"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16370"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16370","entryfile":"elife-16370-v2.xml","files":["elife-16370-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16370-v1.xml"]}
