Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding the optimal dose, duration, and mechanisms of action in the context of healthy aging. Here we show that 3 months of rapamycin treatment is sufficient to increase life expectancy by up to 60% and improve measures of healthspan in middle-aged mice. This transient treatment is also associated with a remodeling of the microbiome, including dramatically increased prevalence of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. We also define a dose in female mice that does not extend lifespan, but is associated with a striking shift in cancer prevalence toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from non-hematopoietic malignancies. These data suggest that a short-term rapamycin treatment late in life has persistent effects that can robustly delay aging, influence cancer prevalence, and modulate the microbiome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16351"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16351"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16351","entryfile":"elife-16351-v2.xml","files":["elife-16351-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16351-v1.xml"]}
