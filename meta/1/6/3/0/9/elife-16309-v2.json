Mammalian TRIM5α proteins are restriction factors and receptors that target the capsid cores of retroviruses and activate ubiquitin-dependent antiviral responses upon capsid recognition. Here, we report crystallographic and functional studies of the TRIM5α B-box 2 domain, which mediates higher-order assembly of TRIM5 proteins. The B-box can form both dimers and trimers, and the trimers can link multiple TRIM5α proteins into a hexagonal net that matches the lattice arrangement of capsid subunits and enables avid capsid binding. Two modes of conformational flexibility allow TRIM5α to accommodate the variable curvature of retroviral capsids. B-box mediated interactions also modulate TRIM5α’s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, by stereochemically restricting how the N-terminal RING domain can dimerize. Overall, these studies define important molecular details of cellular recognition of retroviruses, and how recognition links to downstream processes to disable the virus.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16309"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16309"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16309","entryfile":"elife-16309-v2.xml","files":["elife-16309-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16309-v1.xml"]}
