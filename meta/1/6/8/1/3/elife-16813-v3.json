Its α1 isoform binds to all three PDZ (PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1) domains of PSD-95, the principal PSD scaffold, and can occupy as many as 15% of these PDZ domains. We present evidence that synGAP-α1 regulates the composition of the PSD by restricting binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95. We show that phosphorylation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Polo-like kinase-2 (PLK2) decreases its affinity for the PDZ domains by several fold, which would free PDZ domains for occupancy by other proteins. Finally, we show that three critical postsynaptic signaling proteins that bind to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 are present in higher concentration in PSDs isolated from mice with a heterozygous deletion of synGAP.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16813"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16813"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16813","entryfile":"elife-16813-v3.xml","files":["elife-16813-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig11-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig12-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig8-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16813-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-16813-v1.xml","elife-16813-v2.xml"]}
