Here, using large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening, we find that KDM3A, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and di-demethylase, plays a pivotal role in anoikis induction. In attached breast epithelial cells, <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression is maintained at low levels by integrin signaling. Following detachment, integrin signaling is decreased resulting in increased <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>KDM3A</italic> substantially reduces apoptosis following detachment and, conversely, ectopic expression of <italic>KDM3A</italic> induces cell death in attached cells. We find that KDM3A promotes anoikis through transcriptional activation of <italic>BNIP3</italic> and <italic>BNIP3L</italic>, which encode pro-apoptotic proteins. Using mouse models of breast cancer metastasis we show that knockdown of <italic>Kdm3a</italic> enhances metastatic potential. Finally, we find defective <italic>KDM3A</italic> expression in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Collectively, our results reveal a novel transcriptional regulatory program that mediates anoikis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16844"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16844"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16844","entryfile":"elife-16844-v2.xml","files":["elife-16844-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16844-v1.xml"]}
