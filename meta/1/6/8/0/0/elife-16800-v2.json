However, widespread adoption of these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16800"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16800"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16800","entryfile":"elife-16800-v2.xml","files":["elife-16800-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16800-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16800-v1.xml"]}
