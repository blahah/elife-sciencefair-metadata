Here, we reveal a network motif in the brain for one of the most fundamental behavioral choices made by bilaterally symmetric animals: whether to respond to a sensory stimulus by moving to the left or to the right. We define network connectivity in the hindbrain important for the lateralized escape behavior of zebrafish and then test the role of neurons by using laser ablations and behavioral studies. Key inhibitory neurons in the circuit lie in a column of morphologically similar cells that is one of a series of such columns that form a developmental and functional ground plan for building hindbrain networks. Repetition within the columns of the network motif we defined may therefore lie at the foundation of other lateralized behavioral choices.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16808"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16808"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16808","entryfile":"elife-16808-v1.xml","files":["elife-16808-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16808-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
