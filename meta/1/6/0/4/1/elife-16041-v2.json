Because direct mechanical stimulation of tip links has not been experimentally possible, this hypothesis has not been tested. We have engineered DNA tethers that link superparamagnetic beads to tip links and exert mechanical forces on the links when exposed to a magnetic-field gradient. By pulling directly on tip links of the bullfrog's sacculus we have evoked transduction currents from hair cells, confirming the hypothesis that tension in the tip links opens transduction channels. This demonstration of direct mechanical access to tip links additionally lays a foundation for experiments probing the mechanics of individual channels.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16041"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16041"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16041","entryfile":"elife-16041-v2.xml","files":["elife-16041-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16041-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16041-v1.xml"]}
