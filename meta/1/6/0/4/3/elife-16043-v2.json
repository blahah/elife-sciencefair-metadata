Previous studies have proposed that loss of <italic>FXN</italic> causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leads to the demise of neurons. Here we describe a ROS independent mechanism that contributes to neurodegeneration in fly <italic>FXN</italic> mutants. We show that loss of <italic>frataxin homolog (fh</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to iron toxicity, which in turn induces sphingolipid synthesis and ectopically activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2). Dampening iron toxicity, inhibiting sphingolipid synthesis by Myriocin, or reducing Pdk1 or Mef2 levels, all effectively suppress neurodegeneration in <italic>fh</italic> mutants. Moreover, increasing dihydrosphingosine activates Mef2 activity through PDK1 in mammalian neuronal cell line suggesting that the mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved. Our results indicate that an iron/sphingolipid/Pdk1/Mef2 pathway may play a role in FRDA.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16043"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16043"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16043","entryfile":"elife-16043-v2.xml","files":["elife-16043-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16043-v1.xml"]}
