Schemes of basal ganglia circuit dynamics generally consider striatal PV+ interneurons to be homogenous, despite considerable heterogeneity in both form and function. We demonstrate that the selective co-expression of another calcium-binding protein, secretagogin (Scgn), separates PV+ interneurons in rat and primate striatum into two topographically-, physiologically- and structurally-distinct cell populations. In rats, these two interneuron populations differed in their firing rates, patterns and relationships with cortical oscillations in vivo. Moreover, the axons of identified PV+/Scgn+ interneurons preferentially targeted the somata of SPNs of the so-called ‘direct pathway’, whereas PV+/Scgn- interneurons preferentially targeted ‘indirect pathway’ SPNs. These two populations of interneurons could therefore provide a substrate through which either of the striatal output pathways can be rapidly and selectively inhibited to subsequently mediate the expression of behavioral routines.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16088"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16088"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16088","entryfile":"elife-16088-v1.xml","files":["elife-16088-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16088-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
