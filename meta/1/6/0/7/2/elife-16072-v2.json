While transcriptional regulation of injury-induced gene expression is widely studied, less is known about the roles of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in post-transcriptional regulation during axon regeneration. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> the CELF (CUGBP and Etr-3 Like Factor) family RBP UNC-75 is required for axon regeneration. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-seq) we identify a set of genes involved in synaptic transmission as mRNA targets of UNC-75. In particular, we show that UNC-75 regulates alternative splicing of two mRNA isoforms of the SNARE Syntaxin/<italic>unc-64</italic>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants lacking <italic>unc-75</italic> or its targets, regenerating axons form growth cones, yet are deficient in extension. Extending these findings to mammalian axon regeneration, we show that mouse <italic>Celf2</italic> expression is upregulated after peripheral nerve injury and that <italic>Celf2</italic> mutant mice are defective in axon regeneration. Further, mRNAs for several Syntaxins show CELF2 dependent regulation. Our data delineate a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway with a conserved role in regenerative axon extension.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16072"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16072"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16072","entryfile":"elife-16072-v2.xml","files":["elife-16072-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16072-v1.xml"]}
