Assembly, turnover, and surveillance of mitochondrial proteins are essential for mitochondrial function and a key task of AAA family members of metalloproteases. We identified a homozygous mutation in the nuclear encoded mitochondrial escape 1-like 1 gene <italic>YME1L1</italic>, member of the AAA protease family, as a cause of a novel mitochondriopathy in a consanguineous pedigree of Saudi Arabian descent. The homozygous missense mutation, located in a highly conserved region in the mitochondrial pre-sequence, inhibits cleavage of YME1L1 by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, which culminates in the rapid degradation of YME1L1 precursor protein. Impaired YME1L1 function causes a proliferation defect and mitochondrial network fragmentation due to abnormal processing of OPA1. Our results identify mutations in <italic>YME1L1</italic> as a cause of a mitochondriopathy with optic nerve atrophy highlighting the importance of YME1L1 for mitochondrial functionality in humans.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16078"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16078"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16078","entryfile":"elife-16078-v2.xml","files":["elife-16078-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16078-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16078-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16078-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16078-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16078-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16078-v1.xml"]}
