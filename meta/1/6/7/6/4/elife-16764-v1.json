Here we explored the relationship between pre-tumor cells and their surrounding stroma in malignant progression of the cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma (MB). We show that activation of the vascular regulatory signalling axis mediated by Norrin (an atypical Wnt)/Frizzled4 (Fzd4) inhibits MB initiation in the <italic>Ptch</italic> mouse model. Loss of Norrin/Fzd4-mediated signalling in endothelial cells, either genetically or by short-term blockade, increases the frequency of pre-tumor lesions and creates a tumor-permissive microenvironment at the earliest, preneoplastic stages of MB. This pro-tumor stroma, characterized by angiogenic remodelling, is associated with an accelerated transition from preneoplasia to malignancy. These data expose a stromal component that regulates the earliest stages of tumorigenesis in the cerebellum, and a novel role for the Norrin/Fzd4 axis as an endogenous anti-tumor signal in the preneoplastic niche.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16764"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16764"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16764","entryfile":"elife-16764-v1.xml","files":["elife-16764-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16764-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
