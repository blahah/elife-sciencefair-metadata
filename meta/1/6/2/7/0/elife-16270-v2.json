To characterize this process, we conducted CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function screens using a cell-based assay in which mitosis is consistently disturbed by centrosome loss. We identified 53BP1 and USP28 as essential components acting upstream of p53, evoking p21-dependent cell cycle arrest in response not only to centrosome loss, but also to other distinct defects causing prolonged mitosis. Intriguingly, 53BP1 mediates p53 activation independently of its DNA repair activity, but requiring its interacting protein USP28 that can directly deubiquitinate p53 in vitro and ectopically stabilize p53 in vivo. Moreover, 53BP1 can transduce prolonged mitosis to cell cycle arrest independently of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), suggesting that while SAC protects mitotic accuracy by slowing down mitosis, 53BP1 and USP28 function in parallel to select against disturbed or delayed mitosis, promoting mitotic efficiency.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16270"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16270"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16270","entryfile":"elife-16270-v2.xml","files":["elife-16270-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16270-v1.xml"]}
