We have identified a virus-encoded protein termed gp37/Dip, which directly binds and inhibits the RNA degradation machinery of its bacterial host. Encoded by giant phage фKZ, this protein associates with two RNA binding sites of the RNase E component of the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> RNA degradosome, occluding them from substrates and resulting in effective inhibition of RNA degradation and processing. The 2.2 Å crystal structure reveals that this novel homo-dimeric protein has no identifiable structural homologues. Our biochemical data indicate that acidic patches on the convex outer surface bind RNase E. Through the activity of Dip, фKZ has evolved a unique mechanism to down regulate a key metabolic process of its host to allow accumulation of viral RNA in infected cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16413"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16413"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16413","entryfile":"elife-16413-v2.xml","files":["elife-16413-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16413-v1.xml"]}
