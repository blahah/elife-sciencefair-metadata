Building on a previously published zoonotic niche map (<xref>Pigott et al., 2014</xref>), this study incorporates new human and animal occurrence data and expands upon the way in which potential bat EVD reservoir species are incorporated. This update demonstrates the potential for incorporating and updating data used to generate the predicted suitability map. A new data portal for sharing such maps is discussed. This output represents the most up-to-date estimate of the extent of EVD zoonotic risk in Africa. These maps can assist in strengthening surveillance and response capacity to contain viral haemorrhagic fevers.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16412"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16412"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16412","entryfile":"elife-16412-v1.xml","files":["elife-16412-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16412-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16412-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16412-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16412-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16412-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16412-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16412-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
