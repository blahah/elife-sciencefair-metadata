For ill-defined reasons, CS degenerate in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and in the transitional zone (TZ) of atrophic zones (AZ), which characterize geographic atrophy (GA). Our experiments confirm the loss of cone segments (CS) in the TZ of patients with GA and show their association with subretinal CD14<sup>+</sup>mononuclear phagocyte (MP) infiltration that is also reported in RP. Using human and mouse MPs in vitro and inflammation-prone <italic>Cx3cr1 </italic>mice in vivo, we demonstrate that MP-derived IL-1β leads to severe CS degeneration. Our results strongly suggest that subretinal MP accumulation participates in the observed pathological photoreceptor changes in these diseases. Inhibiting subretinal MP accumulation or Il-1β might protect the CS and help preserve high acuity daytime vision in conditions characterized by subretinal inflammation, such as AMD and RP.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16490"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16490"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16490","entryfile":"elife-16490-v2.xml","files":["elife-16490-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16490-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16490-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16490-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16490-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16490-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16490-v1.xml"]}
