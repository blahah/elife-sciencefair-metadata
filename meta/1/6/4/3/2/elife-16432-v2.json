Here, we show that interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) is necessary for NRASQ61K-induced transformation and melanoma growth. <italic>IFI6</italic> was transcriptionally upregulated by NRASQ61K, and knockdown of <italic>IFI6</italic> resulted in DNA replication stress due to dysregulated DNA replication via E2F2. This stress consequentially inhibited cellular transformation and melanoma growth via senescence or apoptosis induction depending on the RB and p53 pathway status of the cells. NRAS-mutant melanoma were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs, and knockdown of <italic>IFI6</italic> increased sensitivity to these drugs. Pharmacological inhibition of <italic>IFI6</italic> expression by the MEK inhibitor trametinib, when combined with DNA replication stress-inducing drugs, blocked NRAS-mutant melanoma growth. Collectively, we demonstrate that IFI6, via E2F2 regulates DNA replication and melanoma development and growth, and this pathway can be pharmacologically targeted to inhibit NRAS-mutant melanoma.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16432"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16432"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16432","entryfile":"elife-16432-v2.xml","files":["elife-16432-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16432-v1.xml"]}
