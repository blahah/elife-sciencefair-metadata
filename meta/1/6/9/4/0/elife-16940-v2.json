However, robustness of this relationship is unknown. We show that superimposition of Estrogen-related receptor gamma (<italic>Errγ</italic>) on the myostatin (Mtn) mouse null background (<italic>Mtn/Errγ</italic>) results in hypertrophic muscle with a high oxidative capacity thus violating the inverse relationship between fibre size and oxidative capacity. We also examined the canonical view that oxidative muscle phenotype positively correlate with Satellite cell number, the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, hypertrophic fibres from <italic>Mtn/Errγ</italic> mouse showed satellite cell deficit which unexpectedly did not affect muscle regeneration. These observations 1) challenge the concept of a constraint between fibre size and oxidative capacity and 2) indicate the important role of the microcirculation in the regenerative capacity of a muscle even when satellite cell numbers are reduced.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16940"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16940"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16940","entryfile":"elife-16940-v2.xml","files":["elife-16940-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16940-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16940-v1.xml"]}
