We investigated the effects of elevated <italic>pmf</italic> on photosynthesis in a library of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutants with altered rates of thylakoid lumen proton efflux, leading to a range of steady-state <italic>pmf</italic> extents. We observed the expected <italic>pmf-</italic>dependent alterations in photosynthetic regulation, but also strong effects on the rate of photosystem II (PSII) photodamage. Detailed analyses indicate this effect is related to an elevated electric field (Δ<italic>ψ</italic>) component of the <italic>pmf</italic>, rather than lumen acidification, which <italic>in vivo</italic> increased PSII charge recombination rates, producing singlet oxygen and subsequent photodamage. The effects are seen even in wild type plants, especially under fluctuating illumination, suggesting that Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-induced photodamage represents a previously unrecognized limiting factor for plant productivity under dynamic environmental conditions seen in the field.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16921"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16921"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16921","entryfile":"elife-16921-v1.xml","files":["elife-16921-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp16-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16921-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
