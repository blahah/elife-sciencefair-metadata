Although a few male-harming mtDNA mutations have been identified, consistent with this ‘Mother’s Curse’, their effect on females has been largely unexplored. Here, we identify COII<sup>G177S</sup>, a mtDNA hypomorph of cytochrome oxidase II, which specifically impairs male fertility due to defects in sperm development and function without impairing other male or female functions. COII<sup>G177S</sup> represents one of the clearest examples of a ‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutation in animals and suggest that the hypomorphic mtDNA mutations like COII<sup>G177S</sup> might specifically impair male gametogenesis. Intriguingly, some <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nuclear genetic backgrounds can fully rescue COII<sup>G177S</sup> -associated sterility, consistent with previously proposed models that nuclear genomes can regulate the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16923"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16923"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16923","entryfile":"elife-16923-v1.xml","files":["elife-16923-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig10-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16923-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
