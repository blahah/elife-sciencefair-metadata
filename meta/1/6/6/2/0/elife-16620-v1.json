{"title":"BubR1 alterations that reinforce mitotic surveillance act against aneuploidy and cancer","author":[{"surname":"Weaver","given-names":"Robbyn L"},{"surname":"Limzerwala","given-names":"Jazeel F"},{"surname":"Naylor","given-names":"Ryan M"},{"surname":"Jeganathan","given-names":"Karthik B"},{"surname":"Baker","given-names":"Darren J"},{"surname":"van Deursen","given-names":"Jan M"}],"abstract":"BubR1 is a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Mutations that reduce BubR1 abundance cause aneuploidization and tumorigenesis in humans and mice, whereas BubR1 overexpression protects against these. However, how supranormal BubR1 expression exerts these beneficial physiological impacts is poorly understood. Here, we used <italic>Bub1b</italic> mutant transgenic mice to explore the role of the amino-terminal (BubR1<sup>N</sup>) and internal (BubR1<sup>I</sup>) Cdc20-binding domains of BubR1 in preventing aneuploidy and safeguarding against cancer. BubR1<sup>N</sup> was necessary, but not sufficient to protect against aneuploidy and cancer. In contrast, BubR1 lacking the internal Cdc20-binding domain provided protection against both, which coincided with improved microtubule-kinetochore attachment error correction and SAC activity. Maximal SAC reinforcement occurred when both the Phe- and D-box of BubR1<sup>I</sup> were disrupted. Thus, while under- or overexpression of most mitotic regulators impairs chromosome segregation fidelity, certain manipulations of BubR1 can positively impact this process and therefore be therapeutically exploited.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16620"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16620"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16620","entryfile":"elife-16620-v1.xml","files":["elife-16620-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16620-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
