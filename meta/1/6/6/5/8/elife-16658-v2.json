Spatial discrimination of electric fields in anesthetized rats allowed us to compare the pathway-specific field potentials corresponding to the gamma-paced CA3 output (CA1 Schaffer potentials) and CA3 somatic inhibition within and between sides. Bilateral excitatory Schaffer gamma waves are generally larger and lead from the right hemisphere with only moderate covariation of amplitude, and drive CA1 pyramidal units more strongly than unilateral waves. CA3 waves lock to the ipsilateral Schaffer potentials, although bilateral coherence was weak. Notably, Schaffer activity may run laterally, as seen after the disruption of the connecting pathways. Thus, asymmetric operations promote the entrainment of CA3-autonomous gamma oscillators bilaterally, synchronizing lateralized gamma strings to converge optimally on CA1 targets. The findings support the view that interhippocampal connections integrate different aspects of information that flow through the left and right lobes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16658"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16658"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16658","entryfile":"elife-16658-v2.xml","files":["elife-16658-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-16658-v1.xml"]}
