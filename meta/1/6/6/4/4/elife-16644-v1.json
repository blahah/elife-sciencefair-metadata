Here we assess the impact of HIV co-infection on the emergence of resistance and transmission of <italic>Mtb</italic> in the largest outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB in South America to date. By combining Bayesian evolutionary analyses and the reconstruction of transmission networks utilizing a new model optimized for TB, we find that HIV co-infection does not significantly affect the transmissibility or the mutation rate of <italic>Mtb</italic> within patients and was not associated with increased emergence of resistance within patients. Our results indicate that the HIV epidemic serves as an amplifier of TB outbreaks by providing a reservoir of susceptible hosts, but that HIV co-infection is not a direct driver for the emergence and transmission of resistant strains.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16644"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16644"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16644","entryfile":"elife-16644-v1.xml","files":["elife-16644-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16644-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
