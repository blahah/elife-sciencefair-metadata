{"title":"A shared numerical representation for action and perception","author":[{"surname":"Anobile","given-names":"Giovanni"},{"surname":"Arrighi","given-names":"Roberto"},{"surname":"Togoli","given-names":"Irene"},{"surname":"Burr","given-names":"David Charles"}],"abstract":"Humans and other species have perceptual mechanisms dedicated to estimating approximate quantity: a <italic>sense of number</italic>. Here we show a clear interaction between self-produced actions and the perceived numerosity of subsequent visual stimuli. A short period of rapid finger-tapping (without sensory feedback) caused subjects to underestimate the number of visual stimuli presented near the tapping region; and a period of slow tapping caused overestimation. The distortions occurred both for stimuli presented sequentially (series of flashes) and simultaneously (clouds of dots); both for magnitude estimation and forced-choice comparison. The adaptation was spatially selective, primarily in external, real-world coordinates. Our results sit well with studies reporting links between perception and action, showing that vision and action share mechanisms that encode numbers: a generalized <italic>number sense</italic>, which estimates the number of self-generated as well as external events.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"16161"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.16161"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"16161","entryfile":"elife-16161-v1.xml","files":["elife-16161-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16161-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16161-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16161-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-16161-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
