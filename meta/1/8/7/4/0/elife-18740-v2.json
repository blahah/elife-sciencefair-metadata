Previously, we adapted classical post-refinement techniques to XFEL diffraction data to produce accurate diffraction data sets from a limited number of diffraction images (<xref>Uervirojnangkoorn et al., 2015</xref>), and went on to use these techniques to obtain a complete data set from crystals of the synaptotagmin-1 / SNARE complex and to determine the structure at 3.5 Å resolution (<xref>Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we describe new advances in our methods and present a reprocessed XFEL data set of the synaptotagmin-1 / SNARE complex. The reprocessing produced small improvements in electron density maps and the refined atomic model. The maps also contained more information than those of a lower resolution (4.1 Å) synchrotron data set. Processing a set of simulated XFEL diffraction images revealed that our methods yield accurate data and atomic models.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18740"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18740"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18740","entryfile":"elife-18740-v2.xml","files":["elife-18740-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18740-v1.xml"]}
