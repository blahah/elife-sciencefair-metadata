In response to certain stress conditions, many mRNA decay factors are enriched in processing bodies (PBs), cellular structures involved in degradation and/or storage of mRNAs. Yet, how cells regulate assembly and disassembly of PBs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in budding yeast, mutations in the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 that prevent ATP hydrolysis, or that affect the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1, the central scaffold of the CCR4-NOT complex and an activator of the Dhh1 ATPase, prevent PB disassembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Intriguingly, this process can be recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic>, since recombinant Dhh1 and RNA, in the presence of ATP, phase-separate into liquid droplets that rapidly dissolve upon addition of Not1. Our results identify the ATPase activity of Dhh1 as a critical regulator of PB formation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18746"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18746"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18746","entryfile":"elife-18746-v2.xml","files":["elife-18746-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18746-v1.xml"]}
