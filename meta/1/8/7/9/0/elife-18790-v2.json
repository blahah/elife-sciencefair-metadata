NPAS1 and NPAS3 must each heterodimerize with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), to form functional transcription complexes capable of DNA binding and gene regulation. Here we examined the crystal structures of multi-domain NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT-DNA complexes, discovering each to contain four putative ligand-binding pockets. Through expanded architectural comparisons between these complexes and HIF-1α-ARNT, HIF-2α-ARNT and CLOCK-BMAL1, we show the wider mammalian bHLH-PAS family is capable of multi-ligand-binding and presents as an ideal class of transcription factors for direct targeting by small-molecule drugs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18790"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18790"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"18790","entryfile":"elife-18790-v2.xml","files":["elife-18790-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18790-v1.xml"]}
