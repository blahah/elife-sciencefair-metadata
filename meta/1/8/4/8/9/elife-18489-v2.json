We assembled a panel of CRC organoids carrying either wild-type or mutant RAS, as well as normal organoids and tumor organoids with a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation. Using this panel, we evaluated RAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations that are currently in clinical trial for RAS mutant cancers. Presence of mutant RAS correlated strongly with resistance to these targeted therapies. This was observed in tumorigenic as well as in normal organoids. Moreover, dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutant organoids induced a transient cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant organoids confirmed this growth arrest upon pan-HER/MEK combination therapy. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18489"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18489"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18489","entryfile":"elife-18489-v2.xml","files":["elife-18489-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18489-v1.xml"]}
