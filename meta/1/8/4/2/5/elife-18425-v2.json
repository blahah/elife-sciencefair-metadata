Little is known about how free radicals induced by natural sunlight are rapidly detected and avoided by animals. We discover that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), previously known only as an electrophile receptor, sensitively detects photochemically active sunlight through nucleophile sensitivity. Rapid light-dependent feeding deterrence in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was mediated only by the TRPA1(A) isoform, despite the TRPA1(A) and TRPA1(B) isoforms having similar electrophile sensitivities. Such isoform dependence re-emerges in the detection of structurally varied nucleophilic compounds and nucleophilicity-accompanying hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Furthermore, these isoform-dependent mechanisms require a common set of TRPA1(A)-specific residues dispensable for electrophile detection. Collectively, TRPA1(A) rapidly responds to natural sunlight intensities through its nucleophile sensitivity as a receptor of photochemically generated radicals, leading to an acute light-induced behavioral shift in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18425"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18425"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18425","entryfile":"elife-18425-v2.xml","files":["elife-18425-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18425-v1.xml"]}
