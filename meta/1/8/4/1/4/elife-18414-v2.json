Blood flow to the affected tissue must be restored quickly if viability and function are to be preserved. We report that disruption of the mixed-lineage protein kinase (MLK) - cJun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in endothelial cells causes severe blockade of blood flow and failure to recover in the murine femoral artery ligation model of hindlimb ischemia. We show that the MLK-JNK pathway is required for the formation of native collateral arteries that can restore circulation following arterial occlusion. Disruption of the MLK-JNK pathway causes decreased Dll4/Notch signaling, excessive sprouting angiogenesis, and defects in developmental vascular morphogenesis. Our analysis demonstrates that the MLK-JNK signaling pathway is a key regulatory mechanism that protects against ischemia in arterial occlusive disease.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18414"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18414"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18414","entryfile":"elife-18414-v2.xml","files":["elife-18414-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18414-v1.xml"]}
