However, there are no data showing how exactly the regulation emerges from specific lipid-protein interactions. Here we show in atomistic detail how the human β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) – a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor – is modulated by cholesterol in an allosteric fashion. Extensive atomistic simulations show that cholesterol regulates β<sub>2</sub>AR by limiting its conformational variability. The mechanism of action is based on the binding of cholesterol at specific high-affinity sites located near the transmembrane helices 5–7 of the receptor. The alternative mechanism, where the β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation would be modulated by membrane-mediated interactions, plays only a minor role. Cholesterol analogues also bind to cholesterol binding sites and impede the structural flexibility of β<sub>2</sub>AR, however cholesterol generates the strongest effect. The results highlight the capacity of lipids to regulate the conformation of membrane receptors through specific interactions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18432"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18432"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18432","entryfile":"elife-18432-v2.xml","files":["elife-18432-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18432-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18432-v1.xml"]}
