However, how these systems function to achieve transcriptional regulation remains very poorly understood. Here, we discover that the histone H2AK119 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is defined by the composition of its catalytic subunits and is highly regulated by RYBP/YAF2-dependent stimulation. In mouse embryonic stem cells, RYBP plays a central role in shaping H2AK119 mono-ubiquitylation at PcG targets and underpins an activity-based communication between PRC1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which is required for normal histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Without normal histone modification-dependent communication between PRC1 and PRC2, repressive Polycomb chromatin domains can erode, rendering target genes susceptible to inappropriate gene expression signals. This suggests that activity-based communication and histone modification-dependent thresholds create a localized form of epigenetic memory required for normal PcG chromatin domain function in gene regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18591"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18591"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18591","entryfile":"elife-18591-v2.xml","files":["elife-18591-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18591-v1.xml"]}
