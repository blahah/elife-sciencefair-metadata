While previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising proofs-of-concept (Serruya et al., 2002; Simeral et al., 2011; Bacher et al., 2015; Nuyujukian et al., 2015; Aflalo et al., 2015; Gilja et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Wolpaw et al., 1998; Hwang et al., 2012; Spüler et al., 2012; Leuthardt et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2002; Schalk et al., 2008; Moran, 2010; Brunner et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Townsend and Platsko, 2016; Vansteensel et al., 2016; Nuyujukian et al., 2016; Carmena et al., 2003; Musallam et al., 2004; Santhanam et al., 2006; Hochberg et al., 2006; Ganguly et al., 2011; O’Doherty et al., 2011; Gilja et al., 2012), the performance of human clinical BCI systems is not yet high enough to support widespread adoption by people with physical limitations of speech. Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI (iBCI) for communication, which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies (Gilja et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2016; Gilja et al., 2012). For all three participants, performance exceeded previous iBCIs (Bacher et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015) as measured by typing rate (by a factor of 1.4–4.2) and information throughput (by a factor of 2.2–4.0). This high level of performance demonstrates the potential utility of iBCIs as powerful assistive communication devices for people with limited motor function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18554"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18554"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"18554","entryfile":"elife-18554-v1.xml","files":["elife-18554-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18554-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
