Atg8 proteins are localized to the membrane in an ubiquitin-like conjugation reaction, but how this conjugation is coupled to the presence of the cargo is unclear. Here we show that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Atg19, Atg34 and the human p62, Optineurin and NDP52 cargo receptors interact with the E3-like enzyme Atg12~Atg5-Atg16, which stimulates Atg8 conjugation. The interaction of Atg19 with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is mediated by its Atg8-interacting motifs (AIMs). We identify the AIM-binding sites in the Atg5 subunit and mutation of these sites impairs selective autophagy. In a reconstituted system the recruitment of the E3 to the prApe1 cargo is sufficient to drive accumulation of conjugated Atg8 at the cargo. The interaction of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and Atg8 with Atg19 is mutually exclusive, which may confer directionality to the system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18544"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18544"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18544","entryfile":"elife-18544-v2.xml","files":["elife-18544-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18544-v1.xml"]}
