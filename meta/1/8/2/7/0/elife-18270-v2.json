{"title":"<italic>MYC</italic> activation and <italic>BCL2L11</italic> silencing by a tumour virus through the large-scale reconfiguration of enhancer-promoter hubs","author":[{"surname":"Wood","given-names":"C David"},{"surname":"Veenstra","given-names":"Hildegonda"},{"surname":"Khasnis","given-names":"Sarika"},{"surname":"Gunnell","given-names":"Andrea"},{"surname":"Webb","given-names":"Helen M"},{"surname":"Shannon-Lowe","given-names":"Claire"},{"surname":"Andrews","given-names":"Simon"},{"surname":"Osborne","given-names":"Cameron S"},{"surname":"West","given-names":"Michelle J"}],"abstract":"Lymphomagenesis in the presence of deregulated <italic>MYC</italic> requires suppression of <italic>MYC</italic>-driven apoptosis, often through downregulation of the pro-apoptotic <italic>BCL2L11</italic> gene (Bim). Transcription factors (EBNAs) encoded by the lymphoma-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activate <italic>MYC</italic> and silence <italic>BCL2L11</italic>. We show that the EBNA2 transactivator activates multiple <italic>MYC</italic> enhancers and reconfigures the <italic>MYC</italic> locus to increase upstream and decrease downstream enhancer-promoter interactions. EBNA2 recruits the BRG1 ATPase of the SWI/SNF remodeller to <italic>MYC</italic> enhancers and BRG1 is required for enhancer-promoter interactions in EBV-infected cells. At <italic>BCL2L11</italic>, we identify a haematopoietic enhancer hub that is inactivated by the EBV repressors EBNA3A and EBNA3C through recruitment of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2. Reversal of enhancer inactivation using an EZH2 inhibitor upregulates <italic>BCL2L11</italic> and induces apoptosis. EBV therefore drives lymphomagenesis by hijacking long-range enhancer hubs and specific cellular co-factors. EBV-driven <italic>MYC</italic> enhancer activation may contribute to the genesis and localisation of <italic>MYC</italic>-Immunoglobulin translocation breakpoints in Burkitt's lymphoma.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18270"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18270"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18270","entryfile":"elife-18270-v2.xml","files":["elife-18270-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18270-v1.xml"]}
