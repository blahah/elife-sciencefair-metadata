{"title":"Mechanism for nuclease regulation in RecBCD","author":[{"surname":"Wilkinson","given-names":"Martin"},{"surname":"Chaban","given-names":"Yuriy"},{"surname":"Wigley","given-names":"Dale B"}],"abstract":"In bacterial cells, processing of double-stranded DNA breaks for repair by homologous recombination is catalysed by AddAB, AdnAB or RecBCD-type helicase-nucleases. These enzyme complexes are highly processive, duplex unwinding and degrading machines that require tight regulation. Here, we report the structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecBCD, determined by cryoEM at 3.8 Å resolution, with a DNA substrate that reveals how the nuclease activity of the complex is activated once unwinding progresses. Extension of the 5’-tail of the unwound duplex induces a large conformational change in the RecD subunit, that is transferred through the RecC subunit to activate the nuclease domain of the RecB subunit. The process involves a SH3 domain that binds to a region of the RecB subunit in a binding mode that is distinct from others observed previously in SH3 domains and, to our knowledge, this is the first example of peptide-binding of an SH3 domain in a bacterial system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18227"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18227"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18227","entryfile":"elife-18227-v1.xml","files":["elife-18227-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18227-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
