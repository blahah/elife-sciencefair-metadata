{"title":"Tet2 and Tet3 cooperate with B-lineage transcription factors to regulate DNA modification and chromatin accessibility","author":[{"surname":"Lio","given-names":"Chan-Wang"},{"surname":"Zhang","given-names":"Jiayuan"},{"surname":"González-Avalos","given-names":"Edahí"},{"surname":"Hogan","given-names":"Patrick G"},{"surname":"Chang","given-names":"Xing"},{"surname":"Rao","given-names":"Anjana"}],"abstract":"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine, facilitating DNA demethylation and generating new epigenetic marks. Here we show that concomitant loss of Tet2 and Tet3 in mice at early B cell stage blocked the pro- to pre-B cell transition in the bone marrow, decreased Irf4 expression and impaired the germline transcription and rearrangement of the Igκ locus. Tet2/3-deficient pro-B cells showed increased CpG methylation at the Igκ 3’ and distal enhancers that was mimicked by depletion of E2A or PU.1, as well as a global decrease in chromatin accessibility at enhancers. Importantly, re-expression of the Tet2 catalytic domain in Tet2/3-deficient B cells resulted in demethylation of the Igκ enhancers and restored their chromatin accessibility. Our data suggest that TET proteins and lineage-specific transcription factors cooperate to influence chromatin accessibility and Igκ enhancer function by modulating the modification status of DNA.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18290"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18290"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18290","entryfile":"elife-18290-v3.xml","files":["elife-18290-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18290-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18290-v1.xml","elife-18290-v2.xml"]}
