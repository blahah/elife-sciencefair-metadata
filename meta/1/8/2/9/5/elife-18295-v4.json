{"title":"Dpp dependent Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to Hh dependent blood progenitors in larval lymph gland of <italic>Drosophila</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Dey","given-names":"Nidhi Sharma"},{"surname":"Ramesh","given-names":"Parvathy"},{"surname":"Chugh","given-names":"Mayank"},{"surname":"Mandal","given-names":"Sudip"},{"surname":"Mandal","given-names":"Lolitika"}],"abstract":"<italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis bears striking resemblance with that of vertebrates, both in the context of distinct phases and the signaling molecules. Even though, there has been no evidence of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the larval lymph gland with its Hedgehog dependent progenitors served as an invertebrate model of progenitor biology. Employing lineage-tracing analyses, we have now identified <italic>Notch</italic> expressing HSCs in the first instar larval lymph gland. Our studies clearly establish the hierarchical relationship between <italic>Notch</italic> expressing HSCs and the previously described <italic>Domeless</italic> expressing progenitors. These HSCs require Decapentapelagic (Dpp) signal from the hematopoietic niche for their maintenance in an identical manner to vertebrate aorta-gonadal-mesonephros (AGM) HSCs. Thus, this study not only extends the conservation across these divergent taxa, but also provides a new model that can be exploited to gain better insight into the AGM related Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18295"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18295"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18295","entryfile":"elife-18295-v4.xml","files":["elife-18295-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig1-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig1-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig2-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig3-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig7-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18295-resp-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-18295-v1.xml","elife-18295-v2.xml","elife-18295-v3.xml"]}
