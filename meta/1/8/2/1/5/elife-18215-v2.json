{"title":"Odd-paired controls frequency doubling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation by altering the pair-rule gene regulatory network","author":[{"surname":"Clark","given-names":"Erik"},{"surname":"Akam","given-names":"Michael"}],"abstract":"The <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo transiently exhibits a double-segment periodicity, defined by the expression of seven 'pair-rule' genes, each in a pattern of seven stripes. At gastrulation, interactions between the pair-rule genes lead to frequency doubling and the patterning of 14 parasegment boundaries. In contrast to earlier stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> anteroposterior patterning, this transition is not well understood. By carefully analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of pair-rule gene expression, we demonstrate that frequency-doubling is precipitated by multiple coordinated changes to the network of regulatory interactions between the pair-rule genes. We identify the broadly expressed but temporally patterned transcription factor, Odd-paired (Opa/Zic), as the cause of these changes, and show that the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries relies on Opa-dependent regulatory interactions. Our findings indicate that the pair-rule gene regulatory network has a temporally modulated topology, permitting the pair-rule genes to play stage-specific patterning roles.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18215"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18215"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18215","entryfile":"elife-18215-v2.xml","files":["elife-18215-app1-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app1-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app1-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app1-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app1-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app1-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app2-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app2-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app2-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app2-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app2-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app2-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-app2-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig8-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig8-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig8-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18215-v1.xml"]}
