{"title":"Allosteric activation of SENP1 by SUMO1 β-grasp domain involves a dock-and-coalesce mechanism","author":[{"surname":"Guo","given-names":"Jingjing"},{"surname":"Zhou","given-names":"Huan-Xiang"}],"abstract":"Small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) are conjugated to proteins to regulate a variety of cellular processes. SENPs are cysteine proteases with a catalytic center located within a channel between two subdomains that catalyzes SUMO C-terminal cleavage for processing of SUMO precursors and de-SUMOylation of target proteins. The β-grasp domain of SUMOs binds to an exosite cleft, and allosterically activates SENPs via an unknown mechanism. Our molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding of the β-grasp domain induces significant conformational and dynamic changes in SENP1, including widening of the exosite cleft and quenching of nanosecond dynamics in all but a distal region. A dock-and-coalesce mechanism emerges for SENP-catalyzed SUMO cleavage: the wedging of the β-grasp domain enables the docking of the proximal portion of the C-terminus and the strengthened cross-channel motional coupling initiates inter-subdomain correlated motions to allow for the distal portion to coalesce around the catalytic center.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18249"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18249"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18249","entryfile":"elife-18249-v2.xml","files":["elife-18249-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18249-v1.xml"]}
