The central nervous system (CNS) is critical for regulating energy balance and coordinating whole body metabolism. However, a role for the CNS in the regulation of metabolism in the context of the exercise remains less clear. Here, using genetically engineered mice we assessed the requirement of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) expression in neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. We found that VMH-specific deletion of SF-1 blunts (a) the reductions in fat mass, (b) improvements in glycemia, and (c) increases in energy expenditure that are associated with exercise training. Unexpectedly, we found that SF-1 deletion in the VMH attenuates metabolic responses of skeletal muscle to exercise, including induction of PGC-1Î± expression. Collectively, this evidence suggests that SF-1 expression in VMH neurons is required for the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18206"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18206"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18206","entryfile":"elife-18206-v2.xml","files":["elife-18206-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18206-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18206-v1.xml"]}
