To understand the mechanism of the tri-subunit CAF-1 complex in this process, we investigated the protein-protein interactions within the CAF-1-H3/H4 architecture using biophysical and biochemical approaches. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry reveal interactions that are essential for CAF-1 function in budding yeast, and importantly indicate that the Cac1 subunit functions as a scaffold within the CAF-1-H3/H4 complex. Cac1 alone not only binds H3/H4 with high affinity, but also promotes histone tetramerization independent of the other subunits. Moreover, we identify a minimal region in the C-terminus of Cac1, including the structured winged helix domain and glutamate/aspartate-rich domain, which is sufficient to induce (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramerization. These findings reveal a key role of Cac1 in histone tetramerization, providing a new model for CAF-1-H3/H4 architecture and function during eukaryotic replication.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18023"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18023"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18023","entryfile":"elife-18023-v1.xml","files":["elife-18023-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18023-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
