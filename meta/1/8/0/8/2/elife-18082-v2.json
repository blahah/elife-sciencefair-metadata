We retrospectively obtained microbiology laboratory and hospital databases of nine public hospitals in northeast Thailand from 2004 to 2010, and linked these with the national death registry to obtain the 30-day mortality outcome. The 30-day mortality in those with MDR community-acquired bacteraemia, healthcare-associated bacteraemia, and hospital-acquired bacteraemia were 35% (549/1555), 49% (247/500), and 53% (640/1198), respectively. We estimate that 19,122 of 45,209 (43%) deaths in patients with hospital-acquired infection due to MDR bacteria in Thailand in 2010 represented excess mortality caused by MDR. We demonstrate that national statistics on the epidemiology and burden of MDR in LMICs could be improved by integrating information from readily available databases. The prevalence and mortality attributable to MDR in Thailand are high. This is likely to reflect the situation in other LMICs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18082"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18082"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18082","entryfile":"elife-18082-v2.xml","files":["elife-18082-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18082-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18082-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18082-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18082-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18082-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18082-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18082-v1.xml"]}
