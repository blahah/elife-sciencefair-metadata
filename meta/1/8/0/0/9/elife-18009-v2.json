{"title":"Visual attention is available at a task-relevant location rapidly after a saccade","author":[{"surname":"Yao","given-names":"Tao"},{"surname":"Ketkar","given-names":"Madhura"},{"surname":"Treue","given-names":"Stefan"},{"surname":"Krishna","given-names":"B Suresh"}],"abstract":"Maintaining attention at a task-relevant spatial location while making eye-movements necessitates a rapid, saccade-synchronized shift of attentional modulation from the neuronal population representing the task-relevant location before the saccade to the one representing it after the saccade. Currently, the precise time at which spatial attention becomes fully allocated to the task-relevant location after the saccade remains unclear. Using a fine-grained temporal analysis of human peri-saccadic detection performance in an attention task, we show that spatial attention is fully available at the task-relevant location within 30 milliseconds after the saccade. Subjects tracked the attentional target veridically throughout our task: i.e. they almost never responded to non-target stimuli. Spatial attention and saccadic processing therefore co-ordinate well to ensure that relevant locations are attentionally enhanced soon after the beginning of each eye fixation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18009"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18009"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18009","entryfile":"elife-18009-v2.xml","files":["elife-18009-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18009-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18009-v1.xml"]}
