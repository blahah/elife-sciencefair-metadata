Mutation of a highly conserved ‘gating charge’ residue in the S4 helix (R1H) confers a resting-state H<sup>+</sup> ‘shuttle’ conductance (G<sub>SH</sub>) in VGCs and Ci VSP, and we now report that R1H is sufficient to reconstitute G<sub>SH</sub> in Hv1 without abrogating G<sub>AQ</sub>. Second-site mutations in S3 (D185A/H) and S4 (N4R) experimentally separate G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> gating, which report thermodynamically distinct initial and final steps, respectively, in the Hv1 activation pathway. The effects of Hv1 mutations on G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> are used to constrain the positions of key side chains in resting- and activated-state VS model structures, providing new insights into the structural basis of VS activation and H<sup>+</sup> transfer mechanisms in Hv1.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18017"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18017"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18017","entryfile":"elife-18017-v2.xml","files":["elife-18017-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18017-v1.xml"]}
