Models mimicking this process are often incomplete due to genetic complexities of tumors and cell lines containing unmapped collaborating mutations. In order to establish a system where individual components of oncogenic signals and metabolic pathways can be readily elucidated, we induced a glycolytic tumor in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc by activating the oncogene PDGF/VEGF-receptor (Pvr). This causes activation of multiple oncogenic pathways including Ras, PI3K/Akt, Raf/ERK, Src and JNK. Together this network of genes stabilizes HifÎ± (Sima) that in turn, transcriptionally up-regulates many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. Collectively, this network of genes also causes inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity resulting in diminished ox-phos levels. The high ROS produced during this process functions as a feedback signal to consolidate this metabolic reprogramming.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18126"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18126"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18126","entryfile":"elife-18126-v2.xml","files":["elife-18126-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18126-v1.xml"]}
