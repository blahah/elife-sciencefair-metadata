{"title":"The structure of SV40 large T hexameric helicase in complex with AT-rich origin DNA","author":[{"surname":"Gai","given-names":"Dahai"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Damian"},{"surname":"Li","given-names":"Shu-Xing"},{"surname":"Chen","given-names":"Xiaojiang S"}],"abstract":"DNA replication is a fundamental biological process. The initial step in eukaryotic DNA replication is the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, including the formation of two head-to-head hexameric helicases around the replication origin. How these hexameric helicases interact with their origin dsDNA remains unknown. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the SV40 Large-T Antigen (LT) hexameric helicase bound to its origin dsDNA. The structure shows that the six subunits form a near-planar ring that interacts with the origin, so that each subunit makes unique contacts with the DNA. The origin dsDNA inside the narrower AAA+ domain channel shows partial melting due to the compression of the two phosphate backbones, forcing Watson-Crick base-pairs within the duplex to flip outward. This structure provides the first snapshot of a hexameric helicase binding to origin dsDNA, and suggests a possible mechanism of origin melting by LT during SV40 replication in eukaryotic cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18129"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18129"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18129","entryfile":"elife-18129-v1.xml","files":["elife-18129-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18129-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
