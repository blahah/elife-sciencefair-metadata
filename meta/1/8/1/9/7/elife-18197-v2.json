The hominoid-specific gene <italic>TBC1D3</italic> undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. Here, we found that expression of <italic>TBC1D3</italic> in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells (vRGs) and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia (oRG), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of <italic>TBC1D3</italic> in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3, was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18197"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18197"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18197","entryfile":"elife-18197-v2.xml","files":["elife-18197-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18197-v1.xml"]}
