The molecular mechanisms governing secretory granule maturation are largely unknown. Here, we investigate a highly conserved protein named HID-1 in a mouse model. A conditional knockout of HID-1 in pancreatic Î² cells leads to glucose intolerance and a remarkable increase in the serum proinsulin/insulin ratio caused by defective proinsulin processing. Large volume three-dimensional electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging reveal that ISGs are much more abundant in the absence of HID-1. We further demonstrate that HID-1 deficiency prevented secretory granule maturation by blocking homotypic fusion of immature secretory granules. Our data identify a novel player during the early maturation of immature secretory granules.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18134"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18134"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18134","entryfile":"elife-18134-v2.xml","files":["elife-18134-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18134-v1.xml"]}
