To understand intrinsic and acquired resistance to inhibition of MAPK signaling, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion screens in the setting of BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition. Loss of <italic>KEAP1</italic>, a negative regulator of NFE2L2/NRF2, modulated the response to BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition in BRAF-, NRAS-, KRAS-, EGFR-, and ALK-mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with inhibitors targeting the RTK/MAPK pathway increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells with intact KEAP1, and loss of KEAP1 abrogated this increase. In addition, loss of KEAP1 altered cell metabolism to allow cells to proliferate in the absence of MAPK signaling. These observations suggest that alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway may promote survival in the presence of multiple inhibitors targeting the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18970"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18970"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18970","entryfile":"elife-18970-v2.xml","files":["elife-18970-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18970-v1.xml"]}
