Nrf1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident transcription factor that is continually retrotranslocated and degraded by the proteasome. Upon proteasome inhibition, Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved to become active. However, the processing enzyme for Nrf1 remains obscure. Here we show that the aspartyl protease DNA-damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2) is required to cleave and activate Nrf1. Deletion of DDI2 reduced the cleaved form of Nrf1 and increased the full-length cytosolic form of Nrf1, resulting in poor upregulation of proteasomes in response to proteasome inhibition. These defects were restored by adding back wild-type DDI2 but not protease-defective DDI2. Our results provide a clue for blocking compensatory proteasome synthesis to improve cancer therapies targeting proteasomes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18357"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18357"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18357","entryfile":"elife-18357-v3.xml","files":["elife-18357-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18357-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18357-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18357-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18357-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18357-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-18357-v1.xml","elife-18357-v2.xml"]}
