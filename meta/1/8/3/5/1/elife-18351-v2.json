Here, we demonstrate that BRAF serves a crucial function in formation of limb skeletal muscles during mouse embryogenesis downstream of MET and acts as a potent inducer of myoblast cell migration. We found that a fraction of BRAF accumulates in the nucleus after activation and endosomal transport to a perinuclear position. Mass spectrometry based screening for potential interaction partners revealed that BRAF interacts and phosphorylates PAX3. Mutation of BRAF dependent phosphorylation sites in PAX3 impaired the ability of PAX3 to promote migration of C2C12 myoblasts indicating that BRAF directly activates PAX3. Since PAX3 stimulates transcription of the <italic>Met</italic> gene we propose that MET signaling via BRAF fuels a positive feedback loop, which maintains high levels of PAX3 and MET activity required for limb muscle precursor cell migration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18351"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18351"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18351","entryfile":"elife-18351-v2.xml","files":["elife-18351-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18351-v1.xml"]}
