One example is <italic>Myo7a</italic> (myosin VIIA), in which deafness mutations affect the development and function of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of hair cells. We describe here a procedure for the isolation of low-abundance protein complexes from stereocilia membrane fractions. Using this procedure, combined with identification and quantitation of proteins with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that MYO7A forms a complex with PDZD7, a paralog of USH1C and DFNB31. MYO7A and PDZD7 interact in tissue-culture cells, and co-localize to the ankle-link region of stereocilia in wild-type but not <italic>Myo7a</italic> mutant mice. Our data thus describe a new paradigm for the interrogation of low-abundance protein complexes in hair cell stereocilia and establish an unanticipated link between MYO7A and PDZD7.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18312"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18312"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"08","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18312","entryfile":"elife-18312-v2.xml","files":["elife-18312-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18312-v1.xml"]}
