How dendrites are guided to specific targets is less understood. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD sensory neuron innervates muscle-skin interface with its elaborate dendritic branches. Here, we found that LECT-2, the ortholog of leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT2), is secreted from the muscles and required for muscle innervation by PVD. Mosaic analyses showed that LECT-2 acted locally to guide the growth of terminal branches. Ectopic expression of LECT-2 from seam cells is sufficient to redirect the PVD dendrites onto seam cells. LECT-2 functions in a multi-protein receptor-ligand complex that also contains two transmembrane ligands on the skin, SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1, and the neuronal transmembrane receptor DMA-1. LECT-2 greatly enhances the binding between SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1. The activation of DMA-1 strictly requires all three ligands, which establishes a combinatorial code to precisely target and pattern dendritic arbors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18345"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18345"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18345","entryfile":"elife-18345-v2.xml","files":["elife-18345-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18345-v1.xml"]}
