We employed fluorescence imaging and GCaMP6 reporter mice to generate retinotopic maps, revealing additional regions of retinotopic organization that extend into barrel and retrosplenial cortices. Aligning retinotopic maps to architectonic borders, we found a mismatch in border location, indicating that architectonic borders are not aligned with the retinotopic transition at the vertical meridian. We also assessed the representation of visual space within each region, finding that four visual areas bordering V1 (LM, P, PM and RL) display complementary representations, with overlap primarily at the central hemifield. Our results extend our understanding of the organization of mouse cortex to include up to 16 distinct retinotopically organized regions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18372"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18372"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18372","entryfile":"elife-18372-v1.xml","files":["elife-18372-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18372-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
