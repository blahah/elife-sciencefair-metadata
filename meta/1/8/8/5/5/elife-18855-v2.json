In exploring how <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> acquires its microbiome, we found that a microbial community influences <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory and egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members. <italic>Drosophila</italic> prefers a <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>-<italic>Acetobacter</italic> co-culture to the same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, <italic>Or42b. Acetobacter</italic> metabolism of <italic>Saccharomyces-</italic>derived ethanol was necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline. Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness benefit to larvae. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support a model whereby emergent metabolites signal a beneficial multispecies microbiome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18855"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18855"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18855","entryfile":"elife-18855-v2.xml","files":["elife-18855-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-18855-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18855-v1.xml"]}
