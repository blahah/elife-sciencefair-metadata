The flagellar capping protein (FliD) regulates filament assembly by chaperoning and sorting flagellin (FliC) proteins after they traverse the hollow filament and exit the growing flagellum tip. In the absence of FliD, flagella are not formed, resulting in impaired motility and infectivity. Here, we report the 2.2 Ã… resolution X-ray crystal structure of FliD from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the first high-resolution structure of any FliD protein from any bacterium. Using this evidence in combination with a multitude of biophysical and functional analyses, we find that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD exhibits unexpected structural similarity to other flagellar proteins at the domain level, adopts a unique hexameric oligomeric state, and depends on flexible determinants for oligomerization. Considering that the flagellin filaments on which FliD oligomers are affixed vary in protofilament number between bacteria, our results suggest that FliD oligomer stoichiometries vary across bacteria to complement their filament assemblies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18857"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18857"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18857","entryfile":"elife-18857-v2.xml","files":["elife-18857-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18857-v1.xml"]}
