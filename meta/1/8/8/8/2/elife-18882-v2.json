{"title":"Fetal and neonatal hematopoietic progenitors are functionally and transcriptionally resistant to <italic>Flt3-</italic>ITD mutations","author":[{"surname":"Porter","given-names":"Shaina N"},{"surname":"Cluster","given-names":"Andrew S"},{"surname":"Yang","given-names":"Wei"},{"surname":"Busken","given-names":"Kelsey A"},{"surname":"Patel","given-names":"Riddhi M"},{"surname":"Ryoo","given-names":"Jiyeon"},{"surname":"Magee","given-names":"Jeffrey A"}],"abstract":"The <italic>FLT3</italic> Internal Tandem Duplication (<italic>FLT3</italic>) mutation is common in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but rare in early childhood AML. It is not clear why this difference occurs. Here we show that <italic>Flt3</italic> and cooperating <italic>Flt3/Runx1</italic> mutations cause hematopoietic stem cell depletion and myeloid progenitor expansion during adult but not fetal stages of murine development. In adult progenitors, FLT3<sup>ITD</sup> simultaneously induces self-renewal and myeloid commitment programs via STAT5-dependent and STAT5-independent mechanisms, respectively. While FLT3<sup>ITD</sup> can activate STAT5 signal transduction prior to birth, this signaling does not alter gene expression until hematopoietic progenitors transition from fetal to adult transcriptional states. Cooperative interactions between <italic>Flt3</italic> and <italic>Runx1</italic> mutations are also blunted in fetal/neonatal progenitors. Fetal/neonatal progenitors may therefore be protected from leukemic transformation because they are not competent to express FLT3<sup>ITD</sup> target genes. Changes in the transcriptional states of developing hematopoietic progenitors may generally shape the mutation spectra of human leukemias.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"18882"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.18882"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"18882","entryfile":"elife-18882-v2.xml","files":["elife-18882-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-18882-v1.xml"]}
