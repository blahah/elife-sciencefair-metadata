Two major serovars of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, Typhi and Typhimurium, have evolved a two-component regulatory system to exist inside <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles in the macrophage, as well as to persist as asymptomatic biofilms in the gallbladder. Here we present evidence that SsrB, a transcriptional regulator encoded on the SPI-2 pathogenicity-island, determines the switch between these two lifestyles by controlling ancestral and horizontally-acquired genes. In the acidic macrophage vacuole, the kinase SsrA phosphorylates SsrB, and SsrB~P relieves silencing of virulence genes and activates their transcription. In the absence of SsrA, unphosphorylated SsrB directs transcription of factors required for biofilm formation specifically by activating <italic>csgD</italic> (<italic>agfD</italic>), the master biofilm regulator by disrupting the silenced, H-NS-bound promoter. Anti-silencing mechanisms thus control the switch between opposing lifestyles.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10747"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10747"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10747","entryfile":"elife-10747-v1.xml","files":["elife-10747-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10747-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
