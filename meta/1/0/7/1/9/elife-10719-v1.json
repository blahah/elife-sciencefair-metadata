A single presentation of a sugar reward to <italic>Drosophila</italic> activates distinct subsets of dopamine neurons that independently induce short- and long-term olfactory memories (STM and LTM, respectively). In this study, we show that a recurrent reward circuit underlies the formation and consolidation of LTM. This feedback circuit is composed of a single class of reward-signaling dopamine neurons (PAM-α1) projecting to a restricted region of the mushroom body (MB), and a specific MB output cell type, MBON-α1, whose dendrites arborize that same MB compartment. Both MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 neurons are required during the acquisition and consolidation of appetitive LTM. MBON-α1 additionally mediates the retrieval of LTM, which is dependent on the dopamine receptor signaling in the MB α/β neurons. Our results suggest that a reward signal transforms a nascent memory trace into a stable LTM using a feedback circuit at the cost of memory specificity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10719"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10719"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10719","entryfile":"elife-10719-v1.xml","files":["elife-10719-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10719-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
