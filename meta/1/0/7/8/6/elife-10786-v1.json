Here, surface-expression of a pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) induces thymocyte metabolic activation, proliferation, survival and differentiation. Besides the pre-TCR, β-selection also requires co-stimulatory signals from Notch receptors - key cell fate determinants in eukaryotes. Here, we show that this Notch-dependence is established through antagonistic signaling by the pre-TCR/Notch effector, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and by inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (Itpkb). Canonically, PI3K is counteracted by the lipid-phosphatases Pten and Inpp5d/SHIP-1. In contrast, Itpkb dampens pre-TCR induced PI3K/Akt signaling by producing IP<sub>4</sub>, a soluble antagonist of the Akt-activating PI3K-product PIP<sub>3</sub>. <italic>Itpkb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> thymocytes are pre-TCR hyperresponsive, hyperactivate Akt, downstream mTOR and metabolism, undergo an accelerated β-selection and can develop to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells without Notch. This is reversed by inhibition of Akt, mTOR or glucose metabolism. Thus, non-canonical PI3K-antagonism by Itpkb restricts pre-TCR induced metabolic activation to enforce coincidence-detection of pre-TCR expression and Notch-engagement.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10786"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10786"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10786","entryfile":"elife-10786-v1.xml","files":["elife-10786-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10786-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
