Despite the importance of MeCP2 levels to brain function, little is known about its regulation. In this study, we report eleven individuals with neuropsychiatric disease and copy-number variations spanning <italic>NUDT21</italic>, which encodes a subunit of pre-mRNA cleavage factor Im. Investigations of <italic>MECP2</italic> mRNA and protein abundance in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells from one <italic>NUDT21</italic> deletion and three duplication cases show that <italic>NUDT21</italic> regulates MeCP2 protein quantity. Elevated <italic>NUDT21</italic> increases usage of the distal polyadenylation site in the <italic>MECP2</italic> 3â€² UTR, resulting in an enrichment of inefficiently translated long mRNA isoforms. Furthermore, normalization of <italic>NUDT21</italic> via siRNA-mediated knockdown in duplication patient lymphoblasts restores MeCP2 to normal levels. Ultimately, we identify <italic>NUDT21</italic> as a novel candidate for intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disease, and elucidate a mechanism of pathogenesis by MeCP2 dysregulation via altered alternative polyadenylation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10782"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10782"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"08","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10782","entryfile":"elife-10782-v3.xml","files":["elife-10782-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10782-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10782-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10782-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10782-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10782-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10782-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10782-v1.xml","elife-10782-v2.xml"]}
