The centerpiece of NPC transport is the assembly of intrinsically disordered polypeptides, known as FG nucleoporins, lining its passageway. Their conformations and collective dynamics during transport are difficult to assess in vivo. In vitro investigations provide partially conflicting results, lending support to different models of transport, which invoke various conformational transitions of the FG nucleoporins induced by the cargo-carrying transport proteins. We show that the spatial organization of FG nucleoporin assemblies with the transport proteins can be understood within a first principles biophysical model with a minimal number of key physical variables, such as the average protein interaction strengths and spatial densities. These results address some of the outstanding controversies and suggest how molecularly divergent NPCs in different species can perform essentially the same function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10785"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10785"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10785","entryfile":"elife-10785-v1.xml","files":["elife-10785-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig11-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig12-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig13-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10785-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
