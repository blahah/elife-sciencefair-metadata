The unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> divides by multiple fission, wherein a ‘counting’ mechanism couples mother cell-size to cell division number allowing production of uniform-sized daughters. We identified a sizer protein, CDKG1, that acts through the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway as a D-cyclin-dependent RB kinase to regulate mitotic counting. Loss of CDKG1 leads to fewer mitotic divisions and large daughters, while mis-expression of CDKG1 causes supernumerous mitotic divisions and small daughters. The concentration of nuclear-localized CDKG1 in pre-mitotic cells is set by mother cell size, and its progressive dilution and degradation with each round of cell division may provide a link between mother cell-size and mitotic division number. Cell-size-dependent accumulation of limiting cell cycle regulators such as CDKG1 is a potentially general mechanism for size control.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10767"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10767"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10767","entryfile":"elife-10767-v2.xml","files":["elife-10767-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10767-v1.xml"]}
