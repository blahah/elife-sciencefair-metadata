{"title":"Evaluation of predictions of the stochastic model of organelle production based on exact distributions","author":[{"surname":"Craven","given-names":"C Jeremy"}],"abstract":"We present a reanalysis of the stochastic model of organelle production and show that the equilibrium distributions for the organelle numbers predicted by this model can be readily calculated in three different scenarios. These three distributions can be identified as standard distributions, and the corresponding exact formulae for their mean and variance can therefore be used in further analysis. This removes the need to rely on stochastic simulations or approximate formulae (derived using the fluctuation dissipation theorem). These calculations allow for further analysis of the predictions of the model. On the basis of this we question the extent to which the model can be used to conclude that peroxisome biogenesis is dominated by de novo production when <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells are grown on glucose medium.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10167"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10167"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10167","entryfile":"elife-10167-v1.xml","files":["elife-10167-app4-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10167-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10167-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10167-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
