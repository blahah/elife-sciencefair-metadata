We find that while the response of mouse CD4+ T cells to antigenic stimulation is bimodal, activated cells exhibit analog responses proportional to signal strength. Gene expression output reflects TCR signal strength, providing a signature of T cell activation. Expression changes rely on a pre-established enhancer landscape and quantitative acetylation at AP-1 binding sites. Finally, we show that graded expression of activation genes depends on ERK pathway activation, suggesting that an ERK-AP-1 axis plays an important role in translating TCR signal strength into proportional activation of enhancers and genes essential for T cell function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10134"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10134"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10134","entryfile":"elife-10134-v1.xml","files":["elife-10134-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10134-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
