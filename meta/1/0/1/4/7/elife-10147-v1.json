A molecular complex scaffolded by the GK protein-interaction domain (GK<sub>PID</sub>) mediates spindle orientation in diverse animal taxa by linking microtubule motor proteins to a marker protein on the cell cortex localized by external cues. Here we illuminate how this complex evolved and commandeered control of spindle orientation from a more ancient mechanism. The complex was assembled through a series of molecular exploitation events, one of which – the evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>’s capacity to bind the cortical marker protein – can be recapitulated by reintroducing a single historical substitution into the reconstructed ancestral GK<sub>PID</sub>. This change revealed and repurposed an ancient molecular surface that previously had a radically different function. We show how the physical simplicity of this binding interface enabled the evolution of a new protein function now essential to the biological complexity of many animals.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10147"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10147"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10147","entryfile":"elife-10147-v1.xml","files":["elife-10147-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10147-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
