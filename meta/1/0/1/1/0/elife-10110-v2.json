In this study, we show that CMK-1 CaMKI regulates the dauer decision as a function of feeding state. CMK-1 acts cell-autonomously in the ASI, and non cell-autonomously in the AWC, sensory neurons to regulate expression of the growth promoting <italic>daf-7</italic> TGF-Î² and <italic>daf-28</italic> insulin-like peptide (ILP) genes, respectively. Feeding state regulates dynamic subcellular localization of CMK-1, and CMK-1-dependent expression of anti-dauer ILP genes, in AWC. A food-regulated balance between anti-dauer ILP signals from AWC and pro-dauer signals regulates neuroendocrine signaling and dauer entry; disruption of this balance in <italic>cmk-1</italic> mutants drives inappropriate dauer formation under well-fed conditions. These results identify mechanisms by which nutrient information is integrated in a small neuronal network to modulate neuroendocrine signaling and developmental plasticity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10110"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10110"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10110","entryfile":"elife-10110-v2.xml","files":["elife-10110-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10110-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10110-v1.xml"]}
