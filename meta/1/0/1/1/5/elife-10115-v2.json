A new pathway controlling PP2A activity in mitosis has been recently described. This pathway includes the Greatwall (GWL) kinase and its substrates endosulfines. At mitotic entry, GWL is activated and phosphorylates endosulfines that then bind and inhibit PP2A. We analysed whether GWL overexpression could participate in cancer development. We show that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation and increases invasive capacities of cells through hyperphosphorylation of the oncogenic kinase AKT. Interestingly, AKT hyperphosphorylation induced by GWL is independent of endosulfines. Rather, GWL induces GSK3 kinase dephosphorylation in its inhibitory sites and subsequent SCF-dependent degradation of the PHLPP phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation. In line with its oncogenic activity, we find that GWL is often overexpressed in human colorectal tumoral tissues. Thus, GWL is a human oncoprotein that promotes the hyperactivation of AKT via the degradation of its phosphatase, PHLPP, in human malignancies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10115"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10115"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10115","entryfile":"elife-10115-v2.xml","files":["elife-10115-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10115-v1.xml"]}
