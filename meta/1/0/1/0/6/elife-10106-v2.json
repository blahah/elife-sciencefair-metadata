{"title":"Acknowledging selection at sub-organismal levels resolves controversy on pro-cooperation mechanisms","author":[{"surname":"Shou","given-names":"Wenying"}],"abstract":"Cooperators who pay a cost to produce publically-available benefits can be exploited by cheaters who do not contribute fairly. How might cooperation persist against cheaters? Two classes of mechanisms are known to promote cooperation: 'partner choice', where a cooperator preferentially interacts with cooperative over cheating partners; and 'partner fidelity feedback', where repeated interactions between individuals ensure that cheaters suffer as their cooperative partners languish (see, for example, <xref>Momeni et al., 2013</xref>). However when both mechanisms can act, differentiating them has generated controversy. Here, I resolve this controversy by noting that selection can operate on organismal and sub-organismal 'entities' such that partner fidelity feedback at sub-organismal level can appear as partner choice at organismal level. I also show that cooperation between multicellular eukaryotes and mitochondria is promoted by partner fidelity feedback and partner choice between sub-organismal entities, in addition to being promoted by partner fidelity feedback between hosts and symbionts, as was previously known.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10106"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10106"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10106","entryfile":"elife-10106-v2.xml","files":["elife-10106-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10106-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10106-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10106-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10106-v1.xml"]}
