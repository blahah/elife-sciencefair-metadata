Amines are also potent odors, with some activating olfactory trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Here, we report that teleost TAARs evolved a new way to recognize amines in a non-classical orientation. Chemical screens de-orphaned eleven zebrafish TAARs, with agonists including serotonin, histamine, tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, and agmatine. Receptors from different clades contact ligands through aspartates on transmembrane Î±-helices III (canonical Asp<sup>3.32</sup>) or V (non-canonical Asp<sup>5.42</sup>), and diamine receptors contain both aspartates. Non-classical monoamine recognition evolved in two steps: an ancestral TAAR acquired Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, gaining diamine sensitivity, and subsequently lost Asp<sup>3.32</sup>. Through this transformation, the fish olfactory system dramatically expanded its capacity to detect amines, ecologically significant aquatic odors. The evolution of a second, alternative solution for amine detection by olfactory receptors highlights the tremendous structural versatility intrinsic to GPCRs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10441"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10441"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"10","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10441","entryfile":"elife-10441-v2.xml","files":["elife-10441-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10441-v1.xml"]}
