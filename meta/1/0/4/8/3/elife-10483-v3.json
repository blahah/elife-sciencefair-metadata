Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Selective targeting of multiple myeloma cell lines through CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is the result of direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4, which is essential for the viability of myeloma cells, and the concomitant repression of the IRF4 target gene <italic>c-MYC</italic>. Ectopic expression of either IRF4 or MYC antagonizes the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, highlighting the IRF4/MYC axis as a key component of its mechanism of action. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10483"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10483"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10483","entryfile":"elife-10483-v3.xml","files":["elife-10483-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10483-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10483-v1.xml","elife-10483-v2.xml"]}
