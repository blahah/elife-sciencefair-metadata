Critical to this process is the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) that produces second messenger cAMP upon receptor-mediated activation by G protein Golf. However, the molecular organization of the G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 signaling axis is not well understood. In this study, we report that in the striatum AC5 exists in a stable pre-coupled complex with subunits of G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer. We use genetic mouse models with disruption in individual components of the complex to reveal hierarchical order of interactions required for AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> stability. We further identify that the assembly of AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex is mediated by PhLP1 chaperone that plays central role in neurotransmitter receptor coupling to cAMP production motor learning. These findings provide evidence for the existence of stable G protein-effector signaling complexes and identify a new component essential for their assembly.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10451"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10451"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10451","entryfile":"elife-10451-v2.xml","files":["elife-10451-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10451-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10451-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10451-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10451-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10451-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10451-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10451-v1.xml"]}
