Here we demonstrate that the dynamics of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling and the cell cycle are prioritised differently depending on the timing of an inflammatory signal. Using iterative experimental and computational analyses, we show physical and functional interactions between NF-κB and the E2 Factor 1 (E2F-1) and E2 Factor 4 (E2F-4) cell cycle regulators. These interactions modulate the NF-κB response. In S-phase, the NF-κB response was delayed or repressed, while cell cycle progression was unimpeded. By contrast, activation of NF-κB at the G1/S boundary resulted in a longer cell cycle and more synchronous initial NF-κB responses between cells. These data identify new mechanisms by which the cellular response to stress is differentially controlled at different stages of the cell cycle.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10473"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10473"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10473","entryfile":"elife-10473-v1.xml","files":["elife-10473-app1-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-app1-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig8-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig8-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10473-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
