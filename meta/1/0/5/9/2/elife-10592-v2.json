TRAF2 deficient mice die around birth, therefore its role in adult tissues is not well-explored. Furthermore, the role of the TRAF2 RING is controversial. It has been claimed that the atypical TRAF2 RING cannot function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase but counterclaimed that TRAF2 RING requires a co-factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, that is generated by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1, to function as an E3 ligase. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Traf2</italic>, but not <italic>Sphk1</italic> deficiency, disrupted TNF mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling and caused epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB and the adaptive immune system, and might therefore represent a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TRAF2 therefore has essential tissue specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sphk1.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10592"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10592"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10592","entryfile":"elife-10592-v2.xml","files":["elife-10592-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10592-v1.xml"]}
