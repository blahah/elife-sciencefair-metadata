Consistently, centriole formation is thought to strictly rely on self-assembly, involving self-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS-6. Here, through reconstitution of de novo synthesis in human cells, we surprisingly found that normal looking centrioles capable of duplication and ciliation can arise in the absence of SAS-6 self-oligomerization. Moreover, whereas canonically duplicated centrioles always form correctly, de novo centrioles are prone to structural errors, even in the presence of SAS-6 self-oligomerization. These results indicate that centriole biogenesis does not strictly depend on SAS-6 self-assembly, and may require preexisting centrioles to ensure structural accuracy, fundamentally deviating from the current paradigm.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10586"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10586"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10586","entryfile":"elife-10586-v2.xml","files":["elife-10586-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10586-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10586-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10586-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10586-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10586-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10586-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10586-v1.xml"]}
