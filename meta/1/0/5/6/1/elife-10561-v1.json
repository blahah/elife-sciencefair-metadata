However, the molecular cues directing intranodal cell migration remain poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) produced by LN fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) acts locally to LPA<sub>2</sub> to induce T-cell motility. In vivo, either specific ablation of LPA-producing ectoenzyme autotaxin in FRCs or LPA<sub>2</sub> deficiency in T cells markedly decreased intranodal T cell motility, and FRC-derived LPA critically affected the LPA<sub>2</sub>-dependent T-cell motility. In vitro, LPA activated the small GTPase RhoA in T cells and limited T-cell adhesion to the underlying substrate via LPA<sub>2</sub>. The LPA-LPA<sub>2</sub> axis also enhanced T-cell migration through narrow pores in a three-dimensional environment, in a ROCK-myosin II-dependent manner. These results strongly suggest that FRC-derived LPA serves as a cell-extrinsic factor that optimizes T-cell movement through the densely packed LN reticular network.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10561"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10561"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10561","entryfile":"elife-10561-v1.xml","files":["elife-10561-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10561-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
