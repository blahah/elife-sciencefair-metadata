Mobilization of DNA transposons by transposase enzymes can cause genomic rearrangements, but our knowledge of human genes derived from transposases is limited. In this study, we find that the protein encoded by human <italic>PGBD5</italic>, the most evolutionarily conserved transposable element-derived gene in vertebrates, can induce stereotypical cut-and-paste DNA transposition in human cells. Genomic integration activity of PGBD5 requires distinct aspartic acid residues in its transposase domain, and specific DNA sequences containing inverted terminal repeats with similarity to <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposons. DNA transposition catalyzed by PGBD5 in human cells occurs genome-wide, with precise transposon excision and preference for insertion at TTAA sites. The apparent conservation of DNA transposition activity by PGBD5 suggests that genomic remodeling contributes to its biological function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10565"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10565"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10565","entryfile":"elife-10565-v2.xml","files":["elife-10565-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10565-v1.xml"]}
