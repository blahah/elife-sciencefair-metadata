However, the arbors of very few long-range projection neurons have been reconstructed in their entirety, as axons with diameters as small as 100 nm arborize in target regions dispersed over many millimeters of tissue. We introduce a platform for high-resolution, three-dimensional fluorescence imaging of complete tissue volumes that enables the visualization and reconstruction of long-range axonal arbors. This platform relies on a high-speed two-photon microscope integrated with a tissue vibratome and a suite of computational tools for large-scale image data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by reconstructing the axonal arbors of multiple neurons in the motor cortex across a single mouse brain.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10566"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10566"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"10566","entryfile":"elife-10566-v2.xml","files":["elife-10566-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10566-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10566-v1.xml"]}
