We meta-analyzed transcriptomic experiments of muscles of ALS patients and mouse models, uncovering a p53 deregulation as common denominator. We then characterized the induction of several p53 family members (p53, p63, p73) and a correlation between the levels of p53 family target genes and the severity of muscle atrophy in ALS patients and mice. In particular, we observed increased p63 protein levels in the fibers of atrophic muscles via denervation-dependent and <italic>-</italic>independent mechanisms. At a functional level, we demonstrated that TAp63 and p53 transactivate the promoter and increased the expression of <italic>Trim63</italic> (MuRF1), an effector of muscle atrophy. Altogether, these results suggest a novel function for p63 as a contributor to muscular atrophic processes <italic>via</italic> the regulation of multiple genes, including the muscle atrophy gene <italic>Trim63</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10528"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10528"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10528","entryfile":"elife-10528-v1.xml","files":["elife-10528-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10528-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
