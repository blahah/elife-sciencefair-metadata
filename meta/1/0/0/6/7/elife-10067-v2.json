We have developed a proteomics approach to quantitatively profile the changes of sulfhydrated cysteines in biological systems. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that sulfhydrated cysteines are part of a wide range of biological functions. In pancreatic β cells exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, elevated H<sub>2</sub>S promotes the sulfhydration of enzymes in energy metabolism and stimulates glycolytic flux. We propose that transcriptional and translational reprogramming by the integrated stress response (ISR) in pancreatic β cells is coupled to metabolic alternations triggered by sulfhydration of key enzymes in intermediary metabolism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10067"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10067"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10067","entryfile":"elife-10067-v2.xml","files":["elife-10067-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10067-v1.xml"]}
