Recent work has revealed tissue-specific roles for ILCs; however, the question of how a small population has large effects on immune homeostasis remains unclear. We identify two mechanisms that ILC3s utilise to exert their effects within intestinal tissue. ILC-driven colitis depends on production of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which recruits and maintains intestinal inflammatory monocytes. ILCs present in the intestine also enter and exit cryptopatches in a highly dynamic process. During colitis, ILC3s mobilize from cryptopatches, a process that can be inhibited by blocking GM-CSF, and mobilization precedes inflammatory foci elsewhere in the tissue. Together these data identify the IL-23R/GM-CSF axis within ILC3 as a key control point in the accumulation of innate effector cells in the intestine and in the spatio-temporal dynamics of ILCs in the intestinal inflammatory response.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10066"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10066"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10066","entryfile":"elife-10066-v1.xml","files":["elife-10066-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10066-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
