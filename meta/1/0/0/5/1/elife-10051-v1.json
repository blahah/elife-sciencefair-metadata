Here, we used single-molecule FRET to monitor the remodeling of mononucleosomes by the yeast SWI/SNF remodeler, RSC. We observed that RSC primarily translocates DNA around the nucleosome without substantial displacement of the H2A-H2B dimer. At the sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the DNA moves largely along or near its canonical wrapping path. The translocation of DNA occurs in a stepwise manner, and at both sites where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, the step size distributions exhibit a peak at approximately 1â€“2 bp. These results suggest that the movement of DNA across the nucleosome is likely coupled directly to DNA translocation by the ATPase at its binding site inside the nucleosome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10051"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10051"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10051","entryfile":"elife-10051-v1.xml","files":["elife-10051-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10051-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
