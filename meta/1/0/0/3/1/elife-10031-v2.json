Indeed, it is established that the ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms regulate energy expenditure and insulin resistance. However, the role of the neuron-specific isoform JNK3 is unclear. Here we demonstrate that JNK3 deficiency causes hyperphagia selectively in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. JNK3 deficiency in neurons that express the leptin receptor LEPRb was sufficient to cause HFD-dependent hyperphagia. Studies of sub-groups of leptin-responsive neurons demonstrated that JNK3 deficiency in AgRP neurons, but not POMC neurons, was sufficient to cause the hyperphagic response. These effects of JNK3 deficiency were associated with enhanced excitatory signaling by AgRP neurons in HFD-fed mice. JNK3 therefore provides a mechanism that contributes to homeostatic regulation of energy balance in response to metabolic stress.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10031"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10031"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10031","entryfile":"elife-10031-v2.xml","files":["elife-10031-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10031-v1.xml"]}
