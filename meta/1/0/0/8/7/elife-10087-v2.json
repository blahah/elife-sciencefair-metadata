The cytokine profile of γδ T cells is hard-wired already during thymic development. Yet, the molecular pathways underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Here we show that signaling via the NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) is essential for the formation of a fully functional γδ T cell compartment. In the absence of NIK, development of Vγ5<sup>+</sup> dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) was halted in the embryonic thymus, and impaired NIK function caused a selective loss of IL-17 expression by γδ T cells. Using a novel conditional mutant of NIK, we could show in vivo that NIK signaling in thymic epithelial cells is essential for the thymic hardwiring of γδ T cell cytokine production.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10087"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10087"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10087","entryfile":"elife-10087-v2.xml","files":["elife-10087-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10087-v1.xml"]}
