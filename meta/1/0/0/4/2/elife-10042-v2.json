Despite recent advances characterising one of these populations, the neuromesodermal progenitors, their nature and relationship to other populations remains unclear. Here we show that neuromesodermal progenitors are a single Sox2<sup>low</sup>T<sup>low</sup> entity whose choice of neural or mesodermal fate is dictated by their position in the progenitor region. The choice of mesoderm fate is Wnt/β-catenin dependent. Wnt/β-catenin signalling is also required for a previously unrecognised phase of progenitor expansion during mid-trunk formation. Lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors represent a distinct committed state that is unable to differentiate to neural fates, even upon overexpression of the neural transcription factor Sox2. They do not require Wnt/β-catenin signalling for mesoderm differentiation. This information aids the correct interpretation of <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic studies and the development of in vitro protocols for generating physiologically-relevant cell populations of clinical interest.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10042"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10042"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10042","entryfile":"elife-10042-v2.xml","files":["elife-10042-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig10-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10042-v1.xml"]}
