While many imprinted genes have been identified in plants, the functional roles of most of them are unknown. In this study, we systematically examine the functional requirement of paternally expressed imprinted genes (<italic>PEGs</italic>) during seed development in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. While none of the 15 analyzed <italic>peg</italic> mutants has qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of seed development, we identify three <italic>PEGs</italic> that establish postzygotic hybridization barriers in the endosperm, revealing that <italic>PEGs</italic> have a major role as speciation genes in plants. Our work reveals that a subset of <italic>PEGs</italic> maintains functional roles in the inbreeding plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that become evident upon deregulated expression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10074"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10074"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10074","entryfile":"elife-10074-v2.xml","files":["elife-10074-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10074-v1.xml"]}
