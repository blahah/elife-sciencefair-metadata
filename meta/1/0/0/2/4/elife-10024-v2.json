Here we present an NIR-stimulable optogenetic platform (termed 'Opto-CRAC') that selectively and remotely controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive gene expression to regulate the function of non-excitable cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. When coupled to upconversion nanoparticles, the optogenetic operation window is shifted from the visible range to NIR wavelengths to enable wireless photoactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling and optogenetic modulation of immunoinflammatory responses. In a mouse model of melanoma by using ovalbumin as surrogate tumor antigen, Opto-CRAC has been shown to act as a genetically-encoded 'photoactivatable adjuvant' to improve antigen-specific immune responses to specifically destruct tumor cells. Our study represents a solid step forward towards the goal of achieving remote and wireless control of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated activities with tailored function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10024"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10024"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10024","entryfile":"elife-10024-v2.xml","files":["elife-10024-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig1-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10024-v1.xml"]}
