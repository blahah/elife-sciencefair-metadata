Cohesin complexes containing meiosis-specific kleisin subunits govern most aspects of meiotic chromosome function, but whether Wapl regulates these complexes remains unknown. We show that during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oogenesis WAPL-1 antagonizes binding of cohesin containing COH-3/4 kleisins, but not REC-8, demonstrating that sensitivity to WAPL-1 is dictated by kleisin identity. By restricting the amount of chromosome-associated COH-3/4 cohesin, WAPL-1 controls chromosome structure throughout meiotic prophase. In the absence of REC-8, WAPL-1 inhibits COH-3/4-mediated cohesion, which requires crossover-fated events formed during meiotic recombination. Thus, WAPL-1 promotes functional specialization of meiotic cohesin: WAPL-1-sensitive COH-3/4 complexes modulate higher-order chromosome structure, while WAPL-1-refractory REC-8 complexes provide stable cohesion. Surprisingly, a WAPL-1-independent mechanism removes cohesin before metaphase I. Our studies provide insight into how meiosis-specific cohesin complexes are regulated to ensure formation of euploid gametes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10851"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10851"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10851","entryfile":"elife-10851-v1.xml","files":["elife-10851-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig4-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10851-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
