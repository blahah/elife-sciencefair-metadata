Recently discovered mutations in ATPase motifs can lead to the multi-system disorder Singleton-Merten Syndrome (SMS) and increased interferon levels, suggesting misregulated signaling by RIG-I. Here we report that SMS mutations phenocopy a mutation that allows ATP binding but prevents hydrolysis. ATPase deficient RIG-I constitutively signals through endogenous RNA and co-purifies with self-RNA even from virus infected cells. Biochemical studies and cryo-electron microscopy identify a 60S ribosomal expansion segment as a dominant self-RNA that is stably bound by ATPase deficient RIG-I. ATP hydrolysis displaces wild-type RIG-I from this self-RNA but not from 5' triphosphate dsRNA. Our results indicate that ATP-hydrolysis prevents recognition of self-RNA and suggest that SMS mutations lead to unintentional signaling through prolonged RNA binding.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10859"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10859"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10859","entryfile":"elife-10859-v3.xml","files":["elife-10859-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10859-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10859-v1.xml","elife-10859-v2.xml"]}
