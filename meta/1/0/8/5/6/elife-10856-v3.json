However, how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes is unknown. Here, we show that PexRD54, an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus, a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10856"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10856"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10856","entryfile":"elife-10856-v3.xml","files":["elife-10856-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-figsupp7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10856-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10856-v1.xml","elife-10856-v2.xml"]}
