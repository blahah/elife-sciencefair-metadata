Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of <italic>Cbfb</italic> but not <italic>Runx1</italic> prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of <italic>Runx1</italic> in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBFβ pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10874"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10874"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10874","entryfile":"elife-10874-v2.xml","files":["elife-10874-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10874-v1.xml"]}
