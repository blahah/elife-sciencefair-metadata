{"title":"Cell-cycle quiescence maintains <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch","author":[{"surname":"Seidel","given-names":"Hannah S"},{"surname":"Kimble","given-names":"Judith"}],"abstract":"Many types of adult stem cells exist in a state of cell-cycle quiescence, yet it has remained unclear whether quiescence plays a role in maintaining the stem cell fate. Here we establish the adult germline of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as a model for facultative stem cell quiescence. We find that mitotically dividing germ cells—including germline stem cells—become quiescent in the absence of food. This quiescence is characterized by a slowing of S phase, a block to M-phase entry, and the ability to re-enter M phase rapidly in response to re-feeding. Further, we demonstrate that cell-cycle quiescence alters the genetic requirements for stem cell maintenance: The signaling pathway required for stem cell maintenance under fed conditions—GLP-1/Notch signaling—becomes dispensable under conditions of quiescence. Thus, cell-cycle quiescence can itself maintain stem cells, independent of the signaling pathway otherwise essential for such maintenance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10832"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10832"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10832","entryfile":"elife-10832-v2.xml","files":["elife-10832-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10832-v1.xml"]}
