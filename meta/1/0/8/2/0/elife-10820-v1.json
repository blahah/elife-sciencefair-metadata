We observed that receptor-negative cancer cells could be stimulated by the soluble chemokines. Searching for alternative receptors we detected that all cells expressing or transfected with transmembrane chemokine ligands bound the soluble chemokines with high affinity and responded by phosphorylation of intracellular kinases, enhanced proliferation and anti-apoptosis. This activity requires the intracellular domain and apparently the dimerization of the transmembrane chemokine ligand. Thus, shed soluble chemokines can generate auto- or paracrine signals by binding and activating their transmembrane forms. We term this novel mechanism “inverse signaling”. We suppose that inverse signaling is an autocrine feedback and fine-tuning system in the communication between cells that in tumors supports stabilization and proliferation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10820"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10820"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10820","entryfile":"elife-10820-v1.xml","files":["elife-10820-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig9-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10820-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
