{"title":"Overflow in science and its implications for trust","author":[{"surname":"Siebert","given-names":"Sabina"},{"surname":"Machesky","given-names":"Laura M."},{"surname":"Insall","given-names":"Robert H."}],"abstract":"To explore increasing concerns about scientific misconduct and data irreproducibility in some areas of science, we interviewed a number of senior biomedical researchers. These interviews revealed a perceived decline in trust in the scientific enterprise, in large part because the quantity of new data exceeds the field's ability to process it appropriately. This phenomenon—which is termed ‘overflow’ in social science—has important implications for the integrity of modern biomedical science.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10825"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10825"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10825","entryfile":"elife-10825-v1.xml","files":["elife-10825-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
