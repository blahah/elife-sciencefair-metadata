{"title":"Cell type-specific pharmacology of NMDA receptors using masked MK801","author":[{"surname":"Yang","given-names":"Yunlei"},{"surname":"Lee","given-names":"Peter"},{"surname":"Sternson","given-names":"Scott M"}],"abstract":"<italic>N</italic>-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA-Rs) are ion channels that are important for synaptic plasticity, which is involved in learning and drug addiction. We show enzymatic targeting of an NMDA-R antagonist, MK801, to a molecularly defined neuronal population with the cell-type-selectivity of genetic methods and the temporal control of pharmacology. We find that NMDA-Rs on dopamine neurons are necessary for cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation, demonstrating that cell type-specific pharmacology can be used to dissect signaling pathways within complex brain circuits.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10206"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10206"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"09","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10206","entryfile":"elife-10206-v2.xml","files":["elife-10206-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10206-v1.xml"]}
