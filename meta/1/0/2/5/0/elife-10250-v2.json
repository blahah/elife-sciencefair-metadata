Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and much of the published literature has focused on neoplastic cell-autonomous processes for these adaptations. We demonstrate that exosomes secreted by patient-derived CAFs can strikingly reprogram the metabolic machinery following their uptake by cancer cells. We find that CAF-derived exosomes (CDEs) inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thereby increasing glycolysis and glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation in cancer cells. Through 13C-labeled isotope labeling experiments we elucidate that exosomes supply amino acids to nutrient-deprived cancer cells in a mechanism similar to macropinocytosis, albeit without the previously described dependence on oncogenic-Kras signaling. Using intra-exosomal metabolomics, we provide compelling evidence that CDEs contain intact metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and TCA-cycle intermediates that are avidly utilized by cancer cells for central carbon metabolism and promoting tumor growth under nutrient deprivation or nutrient stressed conditions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10250"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10250"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10250","entryfile":"elife-10250-v2.xml","files":["elife-10250-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10250-v1.xml"]}
