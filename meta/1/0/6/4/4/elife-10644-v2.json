Here, we provide evidence that this activity at a distance depends on both sites of high kinase concentration and the bistability of a coupled kinase-phosphatase system. We reconstitute this bistable behavior and hysteresis using purified components to reveal co-existence of distinct high and low Aurora B activity states, sustained by a two-component kinase autoactivation mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate these non-linear regimes in live cells using a FRET-based phosphorylation sensor, and provide a mechanistic theoretical model for spatial regulation of Aurora B phosphorylation. We propose that bistability of an Aurora B-phosphatase system underlies formation of spatial phosphorylation patterns, which are generated and spread from sites of kinase autoactivation, thereby regulating cell division.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10644"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10644"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10644","entryfile":"elife-10644-v2.xml","files":["elife-10644-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10644-v1.xml"]}
