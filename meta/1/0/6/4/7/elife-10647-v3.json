The processes that modulate SOX2 activity to promote pluripotency are not well understood. Here, we show SOX2 is <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified in its transactivation domain during reprogramming and in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Upon induction of differentiation SOX2 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation at serine 248 is decreased. Replacing wild type with an <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 (S248A) increases reprogramming efficiency. ESCs with <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 exhibit alterations in gene expression. This change correlates with altered protein-protein interactions and genomic occupancy of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 compared to wild type. In addition, SOX2 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation impairs the SOX2-PARP1 interaction, which has been shown to regulate ESC self-renewal. These findings show that SOX2 activity is modulated by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc, and provide a novel regulatory mechanism for this crucial pluripotency transcription factor.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10647"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10647"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10647","entryfile":"elife-10647-v3.xml","files":["elife-10647-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig1-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig1-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig1-figsupp7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10647-v1.xml","elife-10647-v2.xml"]}
