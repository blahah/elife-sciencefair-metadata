{"title":"Binary architecture of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2-β2 signaling complex","author":[{"surname":"Das","given-names":"Samir"},{"surname":"Gilchrist","given-names":"John"},{"surname":"Bosmans","given-names":"Frank"},{"surname":"Van Petegem","given-names":"Filip"}],"abstract":"To investigate the mechanisms by which β-subunits influence Na<sub>v</sub> channel function, we solved the crystal structure of the β2 extracellular domain at 1.35Å. We combined these data with known bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel structural insights and novel functional studies to determine the interactions of specific residues in β2 with Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. We identified a flexible loop formed by <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys, a unique feature among the four β-subunit isoforms. Moreover, we found that <sup>55</sup>Cys helps to determine the influence of β2 on Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin susceptibility. Further mutagenesis combined with the use of spider toxins reveals that <sup>55</sup>Cys forms a disulfide bond with <sup>910</sup>Cys in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 domain II pore loop, thereby suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry. Our results also provide clues as to which disulfide bonds are formed between adjacent Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 <sup>912/918</sup>Cys residues. The concepts emerging from this work will help to form a model reflecting the β-subunit location in a Na<sub>v</sub> channel complex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10960"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10960"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10960","entryfile":"elife-10960-v1.xml","files":["elife-10960-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10960-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
