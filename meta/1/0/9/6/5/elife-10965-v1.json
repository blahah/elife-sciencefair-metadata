{"title":"Community effects in regulation of translation","author":[{"surname":"Macdonald","given-names":"Paul M"},{"surname":"Kanke","given-names":"Matt"},{"surname":"Kenny","given-names":"Andrew"}],"abstract":"Certain forms of translational regulation, and translation itself, rely on long-range interactions between proteins bound to the different ends of mRNAs. A widespread assumption is that such interactions occur only in <italic>cis</italic>, between the two ends of a single transcript. However, certain translational regulatory defects of the <italic>Drosophila oskar (osk)</italic> mRNA can be rescued in <italic>trans</italic>. We proposed that inter-transcript interactions, promoted by assembly of the mRNAs in particles, allow regulatory elements to act in <italic>trans</italic>. Here we confirm predictions of that model and show that disruption of PTB-dependent particle assembly inhibits rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. Communication between transcripts is not limited to different <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs, as regulation imposed by <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements embedded in the <italic>osk</italic> mRNA spreads to <italic>gurken</italic> mRNA. We conclude that community effects exist in translational regulation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10965"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10965"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10965","entryfile":"elife-10965-v1.xml","files":["elife-10965-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10965-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
