Here, we show that P1-HNF4α is expressed primarily in the differentiated compartment of the mouse colonic crypt and P2-HNF4α in the proliferative compartment. Exon swap mice that express only P1- or only P2-HNF4α have different colonic gene expression profiles, interacting proteins, cellular migration, ion transport and epithelial barrier function. The mice also exhibit altered susceptibilities to experimental colitis (DSS) and colitis-associated colon cancer (AOM+DSS). When P2-HNF4α-only mice (which have elevated levels of the cytokine resistin-like β, RELMβ, and are extremely sensitive to DSS) are crossed with <italic>Retnlb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, they are rescued from mortality. Furthermore, P2-HNF4α binds and preferentially activates the RELMβ promoter. In summary, HNF4α isoforms perform non-redundant functions in the colon under conditions of stress, underscoring the importance of tracking them both in colitis and colon cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10903"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10903"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10903","entryfile":"elife-10903-v3.xml","files":["elife-10903-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-10903-v1.xml","elife-10903-v2.xml"]}
