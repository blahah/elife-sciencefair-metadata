However, how much cell environment is crucial for subtype determination still remained unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of <italic>Protocadherin20 (Pcdh20</italic>), which is expressed in post-migratory neurons of layer 4 (L4) lineage, caused the cells to localize in L2/3. The ectopically positioned “future L4 neurons” lost their L4 characteristics but acquired L2/3 characteristics. Knockdown of a cytoskeletal protein in the future L4 neurons, which caused random disruption of positioning, also showed that those accidentally located in L4 acquired the L4 characteristics. Moreover, restoration of positioning of the <italic>Pcdh20</italic>-knockdown neurons into L4 rescued the specification failure. We further suggest that the thalamocortical axons provide a positional cue to specify L4 identity. These results suggest that the L4 identity is not completely determined at the time of birth but ensured by the surrounding environment after appropriate positioning.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10907"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10907"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10907","entryfile":"elife-10907-v1.xml","files":["elife-10907-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10907-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
