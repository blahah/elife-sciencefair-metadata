Along with the t-SNARE Syntaxin 18, we now reveal the complete complement of SNAREs required in this process, t-SNAREs BNIP1 and USE1, and v-SNARE YKT6. TANGO1 recruits YKT6-containing ER Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) membranes to procollagen VII-enriched patches on the ER. Moreover residues 1214-1396, that include the first coiled coil of TANGO1, specifically recruit ERGIC membranes even when targeted to mitochondria. TANGO1 is thus pivotal in concentrating procollagen VII in the lumen and recruiting ERGIC membranes on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER. Our data reveal that growth of a mega transport carrier for collagen export from the ER is not by acquisition of a larger patch of ER membrane, but instead by addition of ERGIC membranes to procollagen-enriched domains of the ER by a TANGO1-mediated process.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10982"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10982"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10982","entryfile":"elife-10982-v2.xml","files":["elife-10982-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10982-v1.xml"]}
