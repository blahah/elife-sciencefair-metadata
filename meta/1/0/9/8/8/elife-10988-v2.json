{"title":"A synaptic F-actin network controls otoferlin-dependent exocytosis in auditory inner hair cells","author":[{"surname":"Vincent","given-names":"Philippe FY"},{"surname":"Bouleau","given-names":"Yohan"},{"surname":"Petit","given-names":"Christine"},{"surname":"Dulon","given-names":"Didier"}],"abstract":"We show that a cage-shaped F-actin network is essential for maintaining a tight spatial organization of Cav1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the synaptic ribbons of auditory inner hair cells. This F-actin network is also found to provide mechanosensitivity to the Cav1.3 channels when varying intracellular hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, this F-actin mesh network attached to the synaptic ribbons directly influences the efficiency of otoferlin-dependent exocytosis and its sensitivity to intracellular hydrostatic pressure, independently of its action on the Cav1.3 channels. We propose a new mechanistic model for vesicle exocytosis in auditory hair cells where the rate of vesicle recruitment to the ribbons is directly controlled by a synaptic F-actin network and changes in intracellular hydrostatic pressure.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10988"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10988"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10988","entryfile":"elife-10988-v2.xml","files":["elife-10988-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10988-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10988-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10988-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10988-v1.xml"]}
