{"title":"No current evidence for widespread dosage compensation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>","author":[{"surname":"Torres","given-names":"Eduardo M"},{"surname":"Springer","given-names":"Michael"},{"surname":"Amon","given-names":"Angelika"}],"abstract":"Previous studies of laboratory strains of budding yeast had shown that when gene copy number is altered experimentally, RNA levels generally scale accordingly. This is true when the copy number of individual genes or entire chromosomes is altered. In a recent study, Hose et al. (2015) reported that this tight correlation between gene copy number and RNA levels is not observed in recently isolated wild <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> variants. To understand the origins of this proposed difference in gene expression regulation between natural variants and laboratory strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we evaluated the karyotype and gene expression studies performed by Hose et al. on wild <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains. In contrast to the results of Hose et al., our reexamination of their data revealed a tight correlation between gene copy number and gene expression. We conclude that widespread dosage compensation occurs neither in laboratory strains nor in natural variants of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10996"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10996"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10996","entryfile":"elife-10996-v1.xml","files":["elife-10996-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10996-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10996-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10996-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10996-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10996-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10996-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-10996-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
