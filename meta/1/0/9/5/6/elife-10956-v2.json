We have uncovered a substantial sex difference in the pathology of the aging gut in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The intestinal epithelium of the aging female undergoes major deterioration, driven by intestinal stem cell (ISC) division, while lower ISC activity in males associates with delay or absence of pathology, and better barrier function, even at old ages. Males succumb to intestinal challenges to which females are resistant, associated with fewer proliferating ISCs, suggesting a trade-off between highly active repair mechanisms and late-life pathology in females. Dietary restriction reduces gut pathology in aging females, and extends female lifespan more than male. By genetic sex reversal of a specific gut region, we induced female-like aging pathologies in males, associated with decreased lifespan, but also with a greater increase in longevity in response to dietary restriction.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"10956"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.10956"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"10956","entryfile":"elife-10956-v2.xml","files":["elife-10956-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-10956-v1.xml"]}
