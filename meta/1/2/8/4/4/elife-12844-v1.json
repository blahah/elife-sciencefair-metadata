{"title":"Why clinical translation cannot succeed without failure","author":[{"surname":"London","given-names":"Alex John"},{"surname":"Kimmelman","given-names":"Jonathan"}],"abstract":"The high rates of attrition that occur in drug development are widely regarded as problematic, but the failure of well-designed studies benefits both researchers and healthcare systems by, for example, generating evidence about disease theories and demonstrating the limits of proven drugs. A wider recognition of these benefits will help the biomedical research enterprise to take full advantage of all the information generated during the drug development process.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12844"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12844"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"11","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12844","entryfile":"elife-12844-v1.xml","files":["elife-12844-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
