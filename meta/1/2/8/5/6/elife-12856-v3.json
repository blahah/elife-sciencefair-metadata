Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif (THDI), however it is not clear how Myo3 specifically acts through Espin1 to regulate the actin bundle assembly and stabilization. Here we discover that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 not only elucidate the mechanism of the binding, but also reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. We also provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12856"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12856"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12856","entryfile":"elife-12856-v3.xml","files":["elife-12856-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12856-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12856-v1.xml","elife-12856-v2.xml"]}
