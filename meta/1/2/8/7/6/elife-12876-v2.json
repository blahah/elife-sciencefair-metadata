NMD is essential for viability in most organisms, but the molecular basis for this requirement is unknown. Here we show that a single, conserved NMD target, the mRNA coding for the stress response factor growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible 45 (GADD45) can account for lethality in <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacking core NMD genes. Moreover, depletion of <italic>Gadd45</italic> in mammalian cells rescues the cell survival defects associated with NMD knockdown. Our findings demonstrate that degradation of <italic>Gadd45</italic> mRNA is the essential NMD function and, surprisingly, that the surveillance of abnormal mRNAs by this pathway is not necessarily required for viability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12876"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12876"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12876","entryfile":"elife-12876-v2.xml","files":["elife-12876-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12876-v1.xml"]}
