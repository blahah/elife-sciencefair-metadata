Here, we identify novel intrinsic regulators of axon regeneration: poly(ADP-ribose) glycohodrolases (PARGs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). PARGs, which remove poly(ADP-ribose) from proteins, act in injured <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA motor neurons to enhance axon regeneration. PARG expression is regulated by DLK signaling, and PARGs mediate DLK function in enhancing axon regeneration. Conversely, PARPs, which add poly(ADP-ribose) to proteins, inhibit axon regeneration of both <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA neurons and mammalian cortical neurons. Furthermore, chemical PARP inhibitors improve axon regeneration when administered after injury. Our results indicate that regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) levels is a critical function of the DLK regeneration pathway, that poly-(ADP ribosylation) inhibits axon regeneration across species, and that chemical inhibition of PARPs can elicit axon regeneration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12734"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12734"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12734","entryfile":"elife-12734-v1.xml","files":["elife-12734-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12734-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12734-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12734-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12734-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12734-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
