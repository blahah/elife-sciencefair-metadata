{"title":"Protein flexibility is required for vesicle tethering at the Golgi","author":[{"surname":"Cheung","given-names":"Pak-yan Patricia"},{"surname":"Limouse","given-names":"Charles"},{"surname":"Mabuchi","given-names":"Hideo"},{"surname":"Pfeffer","given-names":"Suzanne R"}],"abstract":"The Golgi is decorated with coiled-coil proteins that may extend long distances to help vesicles find their targets. GCC185 is a trans Golgi-associated protein that captures vesicles inbound from late endosomes. Although predicted to be relatively rigid and highly extended, we show that flexibility in a central region is required for GCC185’s ability to function in a vesicle tethering cycle. Proximity ligation experiments show that that GCC185’s N-and C-termini are within <40 nm of each other on the Golgi. In physiological buffers without fixatives, atomic force microscopy reveals that GCC185 is shorter than predicted, and its flexibility is due to a central bubble that represents local unwinding of specific sequences. Moreover, 85% of the N-termini are splayed, and the splayed N-terminus can capture transport vesicles in vitro. These unexpected features support a model in which GCC185 collapses onto the Golgi surface, perhaps by binding to Rab GTPases, to mediate vesicle tethering.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12790"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12790"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12790","entryfile":"elife-12790-v2.xml","files":["elife-12790-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12790-v1.xml"]}
