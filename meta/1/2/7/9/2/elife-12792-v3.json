Cell-based studies demonstrated that these mutants confer ERα constitutive activity and antiestrogen resistance and suggest that ligand-binding domain dysfunction leads to endocrine therapy resistance. Here, we integrate biophysical and structural biology data to reveal how these mutations lead to a constitutively active and antiestrogen-resistant ERα. We show that these mutant ERs recruit coactivator in the absence of hormone while their affinities for estrogen agonist (estradiol) and antagonist (4-hydroxytamoxifen) are reduced. Further, they confer antiestrogen resistance by altering the conformational dynamics of the loop connecting Helix 11 and Helix 12 in the ligand-binding domain of ERα, which leads to a stabilized agonist state and an altered antagonist state that resists inhibition.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12792"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12792"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12792","entryfile":"elife-12792-v3.xml","files":["elife-12792-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp11-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp12-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-figsupp9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig5-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig7-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig7-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig7-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig7-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12792-v1.xml","elife-12792-v2.xml"]}
