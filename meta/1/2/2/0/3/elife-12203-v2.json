Here, we provide evidence that ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly to maintain actomyosin contractility and cell proliferation and that their loss leads to cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. This phenotype arises from down-regulation of the essential cell-cycle proteins CyclinA, CKS1 and CDK1. Accordingly, while the loss of either <italic>Rock1</italic> or <italic>Rock2</italic> had no negative impact on tumorigenesis in mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, loss of both blocked tumor formation, as no tumors arise in which both <italic>Rock1</italic> and <italic>Rock2</italic> have been genetically deleted. Our results reveal an indispensable role for ROCK, yet redundant role for isoforms 1 and 2, in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, possibly through the maintenance of cellular contractility.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12203"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12203"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"12203","entryfile":"elife-12203-v2.xml","files":["elife-12203-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12203-v1.xml"]}
