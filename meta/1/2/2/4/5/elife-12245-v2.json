Defects in the autophagy pathway have been observed in neurodegenerative disorders; however, no genetically-inherited pathogenic mutations in any of the core autophagy-related (<italic>ATG</italic>) genes have been reported in human patients to date. We identified a homozygous missense mutation, changing a conserved amino acid, in <italic>ATG5</italic> in two siblings with congenital ataxia, mental retardation, and developmental delay. The subjects' cells display a decrease in autophagy flux and defects in conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5. The homologous mutation in yeast demonstrates a 30-50% reduction of induced autophagy. Flies in which Atg5 is substituted with the mutant human ATG5 exhibit severe movement disorder, in contrast to flies expressing the wild-type human protein. Our results demonstrate the critical role of autophagy in preventing neurological diseases and maintaining neuronal health.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12245"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12245"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12245","entryfile":"elife-12245-v2.xml","files":["elife-12245-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12245-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12245-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12245-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12245-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12245-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12245-v1.xml"]}
