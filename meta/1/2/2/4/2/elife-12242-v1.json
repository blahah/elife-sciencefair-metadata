Here we show that in vivo delivery of an engineered DNA-binding protein uncoupled from the repressor domain can produce efficient and gene-specific transcriptional silencing. To interfere with RHODOPSIN (<italic>RHO</italic>) gain-of-function mutations we engineered the ZF6-DNA-binding protein (ZF6-DB) that targets 20 base pairs (bp) of a <italic>RHOcis</italic>-regulatory element (CRE) and demonstrate <italic>Rho</italic> specific transcriptional silencing upon adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated expression in photoreceptors. The data show that the 20 bp-long genomic DNA sequence is necessary for <italic>RHO</italic> expression and that photoreceptor delivery of the corresponding cognate synthetic trans-acting factor ZF6-DB without the intrinsic transcriptional repression properties of the canonical ED blocks <italic>Rho</italic> expression with negligible genome-wide transcript perturbations. The data support DNA-binding-mediated silencing as a novel mode to treat gain-of-function mutations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12242"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12242"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12242","entryfile":"elife-12242-v1.xml","files":["elife-12242-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12242-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
