We report that hemocytes in the caterpillar, <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> are able to synthesize 5-HT following activation by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibition of a serotonin-generating enzyme with either pharmacological blockade or RNAi knock-down impaired hemocyte phagocytosis. Biochemical and functional experiments showed that naive hemocytes primarily express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. The blockade of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> significantly reduced phagocytic ability; however, the blockade of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> increased hemocyte phagocytosis. The 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-null <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mutants showed higher mortality than controls when infected with bacteria, due to their decreased phagocytotic ability. Flies expressing 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> or 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> RNAi in hemocytes also showed similar sensitivity to infection. Combined, these data demonstrate that 5-HT mediates hemocyte phagocytosis through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors and serotonergic signaling performs critical modulatory functions in immune systems of animals separated by 500 million years of evolution.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12241"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12241"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12241","entryfile":"elife-12241-v2.xml","files":["elife-12241-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12241-v1.xml"]}
