{"title":"Tethering of an E3 ligase by PCM1 regulates the abundance of centrosomal KIAA0586/Talpid3 and promotes ciliogenesis","author":[{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Lei"},{"surname":"Lee","given-names":"Kwanwoo"},{"surname":"Malonis","given-names":"Ryan"},{"surname":"Sanchez","given-names":"Irma"},{"surname":"Dynlacht","given-names":"Brian D"}],"abstract":"To elucidate the role of centriolar satellites in ciliogenesis, we deleted the gene encoding the PCM1 protein, an integral component of satellites. <italic>PCM1</italic> null human cells show marked defects in ciliogenesis, precipitated by the loss of specific proteins from satellites and their relocation to centrioles. We find that an amino-terminal domain of PCM1 can restore ciliogenesis and satellite localization of certain proteins, but not others, pinpointing unique roles for PCM1 and a group of satellite proteins in cilium assembly. Remarkably, we find that PCM1 is essential for tethering the E3 ligase, Mindbomb1 (Mib1), to satellites. In the absence of <italic>PCM1</italic>, Mib1 destabilizes Talpid3 through poly-ubiquitylation and suppresses cilium assembly. Loss of PCM1 blocks ciliogenesis by abrogating recruitment of ciliary vesicles associated with the Talpid3-binding protein, Rab8, which can be reversed by inactivating Mib1. Thus, PCM1 promotes ciliogenesis by tethering a key E3 ligase to satellites and restricting it from centrioles.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12950"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12950"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12950","entryfile":"elife-12950-v1.xml","files":["elife-12950-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12950-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
