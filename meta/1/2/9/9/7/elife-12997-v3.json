We previously found genetic clearance of senescent cells from progeroid INK-ATTAC mice prevents lipodystrophy. Here we show that primary human senescent fat progenitors secrete activin A and directly inhibit adipogenesis in non-senescent progenitors. Blocking activin A partially restored lipid accumulation and expression of key adipogenic markers in differentiating progenitors exposed to senescent cells. Mouse fat tissue activin A increased with aging. Clearing senescent cells from 18-month-old naturally-aged INK-ATTAC mice reduced circulating activin A, blunted fat loss, and enhanced adipogenic transcription factor expression within 3 weeks. JAK inhibitor suppressed senescent cell activin A production and blunted senescent cell-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis. Eight weeks-treatment with ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved JAK1/2 inhibitor, reduced circulating activin A, preserved fat mass, reduced lipotoxicity, and increased insulin sensitivity in 22-month-old mice. Our study indicates targeting senescent cells or their products may alleviate age-related dysfunction of progenitors, adipose tissue, and metabolism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12997"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12997"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12997","entryfile":"elife-12997-v3.xml","files":["elife-12997-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12997-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12997-v1.xml","elife-12997-v2.xml"]}
