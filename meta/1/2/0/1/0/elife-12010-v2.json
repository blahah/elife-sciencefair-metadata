{"title":"The p38 MAP kinase pathway modulates the hypoxia response and glutamate receptor trafficking in aging neurons","author":[{"surname":"Park","given-names":"Eun Chan"},{"surname":"Rongo","given-names":"Christopher"}],"abstract":"Neurons are sensitive to low oxygen (hypoxia) and employ a conserved pathway to combat its effects. Here, we show that p38 MAP Kinase (MAPK) modulates this hypoxia response pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Mutants lacking p38 MAPK components <italic>pmk-1</italic> or <italic>sek-1</italic> resemble mutants lacking the hypoxia response component and prolyl hydroxylase <italic>egl-9</italic>, with impaired subcellular localization of Mint orthologue LIN-10, internalization of glutamate receptor GLR-1, and depression of GLR-1-mediated behaviors. Loss of p38 MAPK impairs EGL-9 protein localization in neurons and activates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1, suggesting that p38 MAPK inhibits the hypoxia response pathway through EGL-9. As animals age, p38 MAPK levels decrease, resulting in GLR-1 internalization; this age-dependent downregulation can be prevented through either p38 MAPK overexpression or removal of CDK-5, an antagonizing kinase. Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK inhibits the hypoxia response pathway and determines how aging neurons respond to hypoxia through a novel mechanism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12010"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12010"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12010","entryfile":"elife-12010-v2.xml","files":["elife-12010-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12010-v1.xml"]}
