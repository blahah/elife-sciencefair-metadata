Here, we use whole genome population sequencing of Atlantic and Baltic herring to reveal the underlying genetic architecture at an unprecedented detailed resolution for both adaptation to a new niche environment and timing of reproduction. We identify almost 500 independent loci associated with a recent niche expansion from marine (Atlantic Ocean) to brackish waters (Baltic Sea), and more than 100 independent loci showing genetic differentiation between spring- and autumn-spawning populations irrespective of geographic origin. Our results show that both coding and non-coding changes contribute to adaptation. Haplotype blocks, often spanning multiple genes and maintained by selection, are associated with genetic differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12081"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12081"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12081","entryfile":"elife-12081-v1.xml","files":["elife-12081-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig2-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12081-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
