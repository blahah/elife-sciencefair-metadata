Two independent disease association signals in the HLA-D region identified two regulatory regions containing 3562 polymorphisms that modified thirty-seven transcription factor binding sites. These extensive functional variations are a new and potent facet of HLA polymorphism. Variations modifying the consensus binding motifs of IRF4 and CTCF in the XL9 regulatory complex modified the transcription of HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 in a chromosome-specific manner, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in the surface expression of HLA-DR and DQ molecules on dendritic cells with SLE risk genotypes, which increases to over 4-fold after stimulation. Similar analyses of fifteen other SLE risk loci identified 1206 functional variants tightly linked with disease-associated SNPs and demonstrated that common disease alleles contain multiple causal variants modulating multiple immune system genes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12089"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12089"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12089","entryfile":"elife-12089-v2.xml","files":["elife-12089-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig15-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig16-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12089-v1.xml"]}
