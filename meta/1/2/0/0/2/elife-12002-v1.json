However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR regulates nociception remain unclear. Here we show that deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a major mTOR downstream effector, which represses eIF4E activity and cap-dependent translation, leads to mechanical, but not thermal pain hypersensitivity. Mice lacking 4E-BP1 exhibit enhanced spinal cord expression of neuroligin 1, a cell-adhesion postsynaptic protein regulating excitatory synapse function, and show increased excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons, and a lowered threshold for induction of synaptic potentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E or genetic reduction of neuroligin 1 levels normalizes the increased excitatory synaptic activity and reverses mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, translational control by 4E-BP1 downstream of mTOR effects the expression of neuroligin 1 and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, and thereby contributes to enhanced mechanical nociception.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12002"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12002"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"12002","entryfile":"elife-12002-v1.xml","files":["elife-12002-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12002-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
