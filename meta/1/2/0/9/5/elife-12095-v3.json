The LPL•GPIHBP1 complex is responsible for margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along capillaries and their lipolytic processing. The current work conceptualizes a model for the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction based on biophysical measurements with hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and zero-length cross-linking. According to this model, GPIHBP1 comprises two functionally distinct domains: (1) an intrinsically disordered acidic N-terminal domain; and (2) a folded C-terminal domain that tethers GPIHBP1 to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. We demonstrate that these domains serve different roles in regulating the kinetics of LPL binding. Importantly, the acidic domain stabilizes LPL catalytic activity by mitigating the global unfolding of LPL's catalytic domain. This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding intravascular lipolysis and GPIHBP1 and LPL mutations causing familial chylomicronemia.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12095"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12095"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12095","entryfile":"elife-12095-v3.xml","files":["elife-12095-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12095-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12095-v1.xml","elife-12095-v2.xml"]}
