{"title":"Mapping oxygen concentration in the awake mouse brain","author":[{"surname":"Lyons","given-names":"Declan G"},{"surname":"Parpaleix","given-names":"Alexandre"},{"surname":"Roche","given-names":"Morgane"},{"surname":"Charpak","given-names":"Serge"}],"abstract":"Although critical for brain function, the physiological values of cerebral oxygen concentration have remained elusive because high-resolution measurements have only been performed during anesthesia, which affects two major parameters modulating tissue oxygenation: neuronal activity and blood flow. Using measurements of capillary erythrocyte-associated transients, fluctuations of oxygen partial pressure (Po<sub>2</sub>) associated with individual erythrocytes, to infer Po<sub>2</sub> in the nearby neuropil, we report the first non-invasive micron-scale mapping of cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> in awake, resting mice. Interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> has similar values in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex, whereas there are large capillary hematocrit and erythrocyte flux differences. Awake tissue Po<sub>2</sub> is about half that under isoflurane anesthesia, and within the cortex, vascular and interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> values display layer-specific differences which dramatically contrast with those recorded under anesthesia. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring energy parameters non-invasively in physiological conditions to precisely quantify and model brain metabolism.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12024"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12024"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12024","entryfile":"elife-12024-v3.xml","files":["elife-12024-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12024-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-12024-v1.xml","elife-12024-v2.xml"]}
