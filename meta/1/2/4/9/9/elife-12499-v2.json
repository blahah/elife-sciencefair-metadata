It is induced by conserved sleep-active neurons that express GABA. However, little is known about how sleep neuron function is determined and how sleep neurons change physiology and behavior systemically. Here, we investigated sleep in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> which is induced by the single sleep-active neuron RIS. We found that the transcription factor LIM-6, which specifies GABAergic function, in parallel determines sleep neuron function through the expression of APTF-1, which specifies the expression of FLP-11 neuropeptides. Surprisingly FLP-11, and not GABA, is the major component that determines the sleep-promoting function of RIS. FLP-11 is constantly expressed in RIS. At sleep onset RIS depolarizes and releases FLP-11 to induce a systemic sleep state.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12499"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12499"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12499","entryfile":"elife-12499-v2.xml","files":["elife-12499-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12499-v1.xml"]}
