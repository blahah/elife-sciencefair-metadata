Here, we identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at the excitatory synapse where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long term potentiation (LTP) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. In particular, we provide evidence for importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12430"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12430"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12430","entryfile":"elife-12430-v1.xml","files":["elife-12430-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12430-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
