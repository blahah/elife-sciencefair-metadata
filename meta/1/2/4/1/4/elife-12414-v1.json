Enhanced production of type I IFNs in <italic>Axl </italic>dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro have led to speculation that inhibition of AXL would promote antiviral responses. Notwithstanding, type I IFNs also exert potent immunosuppressive functions. Here we demonstrate that ablation of AXL enhances the susceptibility to infection by influenza A virus and West Nile virus. The increased type I IFN response in <italic>Axl</italic> mice was associated with diminished DC maturation, reduced production of IL-1β, and defective antiviral T cell immunity. Blockade of type I IFN receptor or administration of IL-1β to <italic>Axl</italic> mice restored the antiviral adaptive response and control of infection. Our results demonstrate that AXL is essential for limiting the immunosuppressive effects of type I IFNs and enabling the induction of protective antiviral adaptive immunity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12414"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12414"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12414","entryfile":"elife-12414-v1.xml","files":["elife-12414-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12414-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
