Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is essential for maintenance of balanced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the intestine. Selective deletion of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> in T cells in mice resulted in spontaneous intestinal inflammation that was characterized by aberrant type 2 responses to dietary and microbiota antigens, and by a loss of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Specific ablation of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in mice demonstrated that autophagy directly promotes their survival and metabolic adaptation in the intestine. Moreover, we also identify an unexpected role for autophagy in directly limiting mucosal T<sub>H</sub>2 cell expansion. These findings provide new insights into the reciprocal control of distinct intestinal T<sub>H</sub> cell responses by autophagy, with important implications for understanding and treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12444"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12444"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"12444","entryfile":"elife-12444-v2.xml","files":["elife-12444-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12444-v1.xml"]}
