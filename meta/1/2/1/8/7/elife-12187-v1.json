Here, we use two novel Bub1 inhibitors, BAY-320 and BAY-524, to demonstrate potent Bub1 kinase inhibition both in vitro and in intact cells. Then, we compared the cellular phenotypes of Bub1 kinase inhibition in HeLa and RPE1 cells with those of protein depletion, indicative of catalytic or scaffolding functions, respectively. Bub1 inhibition affected chromosome association of Shugoshin and the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), without abolishing global Aurora B function. Consequently, inhibition of Bub1 kinase impaired chromosome arm resolution but exerted only minor effects on mitotic progression or SAC function. Importantly, BAY-320 and BAY-524 treatment sensitized cells to low doses of Paclitaxel, impairing both chromosome segregation and cell proliferation. These findings are relevant to our understanding of Bub1 kinase function and the prospects of targeting Bub1 for therapeutic applications.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12187"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12187"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12187","entryfile":"elife-12187-v1.xml","files":["elife-12187-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig1-figsupp1-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig1-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig2-figsupp1-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig2-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig3-figsupp1-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig3-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig4-figsupp1-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig4-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig5-figsupp1-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig5-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig6-figsupp1-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig6-figsupp2-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig6-figsupp2-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig6-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig7-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-fig8-v1-v1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12187-v1-v1-v1.xml"]}
