Here we investigate the relevance of the satellite cell (SC) niche in sarcoma development by using Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) to perturb the niche microenvironment. In a <italic>Pax7</italic> wild type background, HGF stimulation mainly causes ERMS that originate from satellite cells following a process of multistep progression. Conversely, in a <italic>Pax7</italic> null genotype ERMS incidence drops, while UPS becomes the most frequent subtype. Murine EfRMS display genetic heterogeneity similar to their human counterpart. Altogether, our data demonstrate that selective perturbation of the SC niche results in distinct sarcoma subtypes in a Pax7 lineage-dependent manner, and define a critical role for the Met axis in sarcoma initiation. Finally, our results provide a rationale for the use of combination therapy, tailored on specific amplifications and activated signaling pathways, to minimize resistance emerging from sarcomas heterogeneity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12116"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12116"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12116","entryfile":"elife-12116-v1.xml","files":["elife-12116-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12116-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
