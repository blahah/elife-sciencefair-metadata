Cholesterol export is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of U18666A, a cationic sterol. To identify the target of U18666A, we synthesized <bold>U-X</bold>, a U18666A derivative with a benzophenone that permits ultraviolet-induced crosslinking. When added to CHO cells, <bold>U-X</bold> crosslinked to NPC1. Crosslinking was blocked by U18666A derivatives that block cholesterol export, but not derivatives lacking blocking activity. Crosslinking was prevented by point mutation in the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) of NPC1, but not by point mutation in the N-terminal domain (NTD). These data suggest that the SSD contains a U18666A-inhibitable site required for cholesterol export distinct from the cholesterol-binding site in the NTD. Inasmuch as inhibition of Ebola requires 100-fold higher concentrations of U18666A, the high affinity U16888A-binding site is likely not required for virus entry.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12177"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12177"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2015"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12177","entryfile":"elife-12177-v2.xml","files":["elife-12177-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12177-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12177-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12177-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12177-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12177-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12177-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12177-v1.xml"]}
