The lack of internal characters and soft-tissue preservation in many arthropod fossils, however, impedes comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and species descriptions according to taxonomic standards for Recent organisms. We found well-preserved three-dimensional anatomy in mineralized arthropods from Paleogene fissure fillings and demonstrate the value of these fossils by utilizing digitally reconstructed anatomical structure of a hister beetle. The new anatomical data facilitate a refinement of the species diagnosis and allowed us to reject a previous hypothesis of close phylogenetic relationship to an extant congeneric species. Our findings suggest that mineralized fossils, even those of macroscopically poor preservation, constitute a rich but yet largely unexploited source of anatomical data for fossil arthropods.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12129"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12129"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12129","entryfile":"elife-12129-v1.xml","files":["elife-12129-app1-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12129-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12129-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12129-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12129-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12129-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12129-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
