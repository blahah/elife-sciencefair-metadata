{"title":"The Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein 2 promotes food intake through inhibition of the Prokineticin Receptor-1","author":[{"surname":"Chaly","given-names":"Anna L"},{"surname":"Srisai","given-names":"Dollada"},{"surname":"Gardner","given-names":"Ellen E"},{"surname":"Sebag","given-names":"Julien A"}],"abstract":"The Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein 2 (MRAP2) is an important regulator of energy homeostasis and its loss causes severe obesity in rodents. MRAP2 mediates its action in part through the potentiation of the MC4R, however, it is clear that MRAP2 is expressed in tissues that do not express MC4R, and that the deletion of MRAP2 does not recapitulate the phenotype of <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice. Consequently, we hypothesized that other GPCRs involved in the control of energy homeostasis are likely to be regulated by MRAP2. In this study we identified PKR1 as the first non-melanocortin GPCR to be regulated by MRAP2. We show that MRAP2 significantly and specifically inhibits PKR1 signaling. We also demonstrate that PKR1 and MRAP2 co-localize in neurons and that <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO mice are hypersensitive to PKR1 stimulation. This study not only identifies new partners of MRAP2 but also a new pathway through which MRAP2 regulates energy homeostasis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12397"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12397"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12397","entryfile":"elife-12397-v2.xml","files":["elife-12397-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12397-v1.xml"]}
