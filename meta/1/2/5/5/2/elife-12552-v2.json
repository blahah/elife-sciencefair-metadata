The human pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> grows in a glycogen-rich vacuole. How this large polymer accumulates there is unknown. We reveal that host glycogen stores shift to the vacuole through two pathways: bulk uptake from the cytoplasmic pool, and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. We provide evidence that bacterial glycogen metabolism enzymes are secreted into the vacuole lumen through type 3 secretion. Our data bring strong support to the following scenario: bacteria co-opt the host transporter SLC35D2 to import UDP-glucose into the vacuole, where it serves as substrate for <italic>de novo</italic> glycogen synthesis, through a remarkable adaptation of the bacterial glycogen synthase. Based on these findings we propose that parasitophorous vacuoles not only offer protection but also provide a microorganism-controlled metabolically active compartment essential for redirecting host resources to the pathogens.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12552"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12552"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12552","entryfile":"elife-12552-v2.xml","files":["elife-12552-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12552-v1.xml"]}
