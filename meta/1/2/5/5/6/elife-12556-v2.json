Currently, little data exist pertaining to peptides that are presented after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. Herein we purify HLA-A*02:01 complexes from <italic>T. gondii</italic> infected cells and characterize the peptide ligands using LCMS. We identify 195 <italic>T. gondii</italic> encoded ligands originating from both secreted and cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, <italic>T. gondii</italic> ligands are significantly longer than uninfected host ligands, and these longer pathogen-derived peptides maintain a canonical N-terminal binding core yet exhibit a C-terminal extension of 1–30 amino acids. Structural analysis demonstrates that binding of extended peptides opens the HLA class I F’ pocket, allowing the C-terminal extension to protrude through one end of the binding groove. In summary, we demonstrate that unrealized structural flexibility makes MHC class I receptive to parasite-derived ligands that exhibit unique C-terminal peptide extensions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12556"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12556"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"01","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12556","entryfile":"elife-12556-v2.xml","files":["elife-12556-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-12556-v1.xml"]}
