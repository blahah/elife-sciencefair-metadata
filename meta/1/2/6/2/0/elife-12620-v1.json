The unicellular cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC\n                    6803 moves with Type IV pili and measures light intensity and color with a range\n                    of photoreceptors. Here, we show that individual <italic>Synechocystis</italic>\n                    cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather\n                    they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source. We show that\n                    directional light sensing is possible because <italic>Synechocystis</italic>\n                    cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and\n                    move towards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the\n                    edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away from the\n                    focused spot. Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the worldâ€™s smallest\n                    and oldest example of a camera eye.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"12620"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.12620"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"12620","entryfile":"elife-12620-v1.xml","files":["elife-12620-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12620-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12620-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12620-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12620-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12620-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-12620-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
