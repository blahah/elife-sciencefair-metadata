{"title":"Sequential phenotypic constraints on social information use in wild baboons","author":[{"surname":"Carter","given-names":"Alecia J"},{"surname":"Torrents Ticó","given-names":"Miquel"},{"surname":"Cowlishaw","given-names":"Guy"}],"abstract":"Social information allows the rapid dissemination of novel information among individuals. However, an individual’s ability to use information is likely to be dependent on phenotypic constraints operating at three successive steps: acquisition, application, and exploitation. We tested this novel framework by quantifying the sequential process of social information use with experimental food patches in wild baboons (<italic>Papio ursinus</italic>). We identified phenotypic constraints at each step of the information use sequence: peripheral individuals in the proximity network were less likely to acquire and apply social information, while subordinate females were less likely to exploit it successfully. Social bonds and personality also played a limiting role along the sequence. As a result of these constraints, the average individual only acquired and exploited social information on <25% and <5% of occasions. Our study highlights the sequential nature of information use and the fundamental importance of phenotypic constraints on this sequence.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13125"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13125"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13125","entryfile":"elife-13125-v1.xml","files":["elife-13125-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13125-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13125-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13125-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
