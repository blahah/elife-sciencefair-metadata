Here we provide direct evidence that under inflammatory conditions, brain endothelial cells (BECs) stimulate the migration of myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells by acting as non-professional antigen presenting cells through the processing and presentation of myelin-derived antigens in MHC-II. Inflamed BECs internalized myelin, which was routed to endo-lysosomal compartment for processing in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, myelin/MHC-II complexes on inflamed BECs stimulated the trans-endothelial migration of myelin-reactive Th1 and Th17 2D2 cells, while control antigen loaded BECs did not stimulate T-cell migration. Furthermore, blocking the interaction between myelin/MHC-II complexes and myelin-reactive T-cells prevented T-cell transmigration. These results demonstrate that endothelial cells derived from the brain are capable of enhancing antigen-specific T cell recruitment.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13149"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13149"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13149","entryfile":"elife-13149-v2.xml","files":["elife-13149-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-resp-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13149-v1.xml"]}
