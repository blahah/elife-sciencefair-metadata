{"title":"Distributed task-specific processing of somatosensory feedback for voluntary motor control","author":[{"surname":"Omrani","given-names":"Mohsen"},{"surname":"Murnaghan","given-names":"Chantelle D"},{"surname":"Pruszynski","given-names":"J Andrew"},{"surname":"Scott","given-names":"Stephen H"}],"abstract":"Corrective responses to limb disturbances are surprisingly complex, but the neural basis of these goal-directed responses is poorly understood. Here we show that somatosensory feedback is transmitted to many sensory and motor cortical regions within 25 ms of a mechanical disturbance applied to the monkeyâ€™s arm. When limb feedback was salient to an ongoing motor action (task engagement), neurons in parietal area 5 immediately (~25 ms) increased their response to limb disturbances, whereas neurons in other regions did not alter their response until 15 to 40 ms later. In contrast, initiation of a motor action elicited by a limb disturbance (target selection) altered neural responses in primary motor cortex ~65 ms after the limb disturbance, and then in dorsal premotor cortex, with no effect in parietal regions until 150 ms post-perturbation. Our findings highlight broad parietofrontal circuits that provide the neural substrate for goal-directed corrections, an essential aspect of highly skilled motor behaviors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13141"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13141"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13141","entryfile":"elife-13141-v2.xml","files":["elife-13141-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13141-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13141-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13141-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13141-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13141-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13141-v1.xml"]}
