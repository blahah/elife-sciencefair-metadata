Here we investigate the function of Pentagone (Pent), a secreted protein that acts in a regulatory feedback during establishment and maintenance of BMP/Dpp morphogen signalling during Drosophila wing development. We show that Pent internalises the Dpp co-receptors, the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein (Dlp), and propose that this internalisation is important in the establishment of a long range Dpp gradient. Pent-induced endocytosis and degradation of glypicans requires dynamin- and Rab5, but not clathrin or active BMP signalling. Thus, Pent modifies the ability of cells to trap and transduce BMP by fine-tuning the levels of the BMP reception system at the plasma membrane. In addition, and in accordance with the role of glypicans in multiple signalling pathways, we establish a requirement of Pent for Wg signalling. Our data propose a novel mechanism by which morphogen signalling is regulated.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13301"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13301"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13301","entryfile":"elife-13301-v3.xml","files":["elife-13301-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13301-v1.xml","elife-13301-v2.xml"]}
