{"title":"Constitutive auxin response in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> reveals complex interactions between Aux/IAA and ARF proteins","author":[{"surname":"Lavy","given-names":"Meirav"},{"surname":"Prigge","given-names":"Michael J"},{"surname":"Tao","given-names":"Sibo"},{"surname":"Shain","given-names":"Stephanie"},{"surname":"Kuo","given-names":"April"},{"surname":"Kirchsteiger","given-names":"Kerstin"},{"surname":"Estelle","given-names":"Mark"}],"abstract":"The coordinated action of the auxin-sensitive Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ARF transcription factors produces complex gene-regulatory networks in plants. Despite their importance, our knowledge of these two protein families is largely based on analysis of stabilized forms of the Aux/IAAs, and studies of a subgroup of ARFs that function as transcriptional activators. To understand how auxin regulates gene expression we generated a <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> line that completely lacks Aux/IAAs. Loss of the repressors causes massive changes in transcription with misregulation of over a third of the annotated genes. Further, we find that the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutant is blind to auxin indicating that auxin regulation of transcription occurs exclusively through Aux/IAA function. We used the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutant as a simplified platform for studies of ARF function and demonstrate that repressing ARFs regulate auxin-induced genes and fine-tune their expression. Further the repressing ARFs coordinate gene induction jointly with activating ARFs and the Aux/IAAs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13325"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13325"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"06","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13325","entryfile":"elife-13325-v1.xml","files":["elife-13325-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13325-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
