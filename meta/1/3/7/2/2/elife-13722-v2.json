It is widely used in cancer histopathology but its functions remain unclear. Here, we show that Ki-67 controls heterochromatin organisation. Altering Ki-67 expression levels did not significantly affect cell proliferation in vivo. Ki-67 mutant mice developed normally and cells lacking Ki-67 proliferated efficiently. Conversely, upregulation of Ki-67 expression in differentiated tissues did not prevent cell cycle arrest. Ki-67 interactors included proteins involved in nucleolar processes and chromatin regulators. Ki-67 depletion disrupted nucleologenesis but did not inhibit pre-rRNA processing. In contrast, it altered gene expression. Ki-67 silencing also had wide-ranging effects on chromatin organisation, disrupting heterochromatin compaction and long-range genomic interactions. Trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 was relocalised within the nucleus. Finally, overexpression of human or <italic>Xenopus</italic> Ki-67 induced ectopic heterochromatin formation. Altogether, our results suggest that Ki-67 expression in proliferating cells spatially organises heterochromatin, thereby controlling gene expression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13722"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13722"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13722","entryfile":"elife-13722-v2.xml","files":["elife-13722-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig10-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig10-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig10-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig10-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig11-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig11-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-figsupp9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13722-v1.xml"]}
