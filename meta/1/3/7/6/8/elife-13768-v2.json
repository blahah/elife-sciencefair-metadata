Here we identify a transcription factor, ABA INSENSITIVE GROWTH 1 (ABIG1) required for abscisic acid (ABA) mediated growth inhibition, but not for stomatal closure. <italic>ABIG1</italic> mRNA levels are increased both in response to drought and in response to ABA treatment. When treated with ABA, <italic>abig1</italic> mutants remain greener and produce more leaves than comparable wild-type plants. When challenged with drought, <italic>abig1</italic> mutants have fewer yellow, senesced leaves than wild-type. Induction of ABIG1 transcription mimics ABA treatment and regulates a set of genes implicated in stress responses. We propose a model in which drought acts through ABA to increase <italic>ABIG1</italic> transcription which in turn restricts new shoot growth and promotes leaf senescence. The results have implications for plant breeding: the existence of a mutant that is both ABA resistant and drought resistant points to new strategies for isolating drought resistant genetic varieties.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13768"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13768"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13768","entryfile":"elife-13768-v2.xml","files":["elife-13768-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13768-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13768-v1.xml"]}
