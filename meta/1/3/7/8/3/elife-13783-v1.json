The VRC01-class bNAb family derived from the VH1-2*02 germline allele arose in multiple HIV-1–infected donors, yet targets the CD4-binding site on Env with common interactions. Modified forms of the 426c Env that activate germline-reverted B cell receptors are candidate immunogens for eliciting VRC01-class bNAbs. We present structures of germline-reverted VRC01-class bNAbs alone and complexed with 426c-based gp120 immunogens. Germline bNAb–426c gp120 complexes showed preservation of VRC01-class signature residues and gp120 contacts, but detectably different binding modes compared to mature bNAb-gp120 complexes. Unlike typical antibody-antigen interactions, VRC01–class germline antibodies exhibited preformed antigen-binding conformations for recognizing immunogens. Affinity maturation introduced substitutions increasing induced-fit recognition and electropositivity, potentially to accommodate negatively-charged complex-type <italic>N</italic>-glycans on gp120. These results provide general principles relevant to the unusual evolution of VRC01–class bNAbs and guidelines for structure-based immunogen design.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13783"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13783"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13783","entryfile":"elife-13783-v1.xml","files":["elife-13783-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13783-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
