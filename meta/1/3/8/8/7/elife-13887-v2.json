Here, we show that the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-resident protein anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), a soluble protein-disulfide isomerase involved in ER protein folding and quality control, is secreted and interacts with the ECM. Extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) is a microenvironmental regulator of epithelial tissue architecture, which plays a role in the preneoplastic phenotype and contributes to epithelial tumorigenicity. Indeed, eAGR2, is secreted as a functionally active protein independently of its thioredoxin-like domain (CXXS) and of its ER-retention domain (KTEL), and is sufficient, by itself, to promote the acquisition of invasive and metastatic features. Therefore, we conclude that eAGR2 plays an extracellular role independent of its ER function and we elucidate this gain-of-function as a novel and unexpected critical ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic regulator of epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13887"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13887"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13887","entryfile":"elife-13887-v2.xml","files":["elife-13887-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13887-v1.xml"]}
