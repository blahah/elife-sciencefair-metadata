Here, we report that these functions depend on SPOPL, a substrate-specific CUL3 adaptor. We find that SPOPL associates with endosomes and is required for both the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the endocytic host cell entry of influenza A virus. In SPOPL-depleted cells, endosomes are enlarged and fail to acquire intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). We identify a critical substrate ubiquitinated by CUL3-SPOPL as EPS15, an endocytic adaptor that also associates with the ESCRT-0 complex members HRS and STAM on endosomes. Indeed, EPS15 is ubiquitinated in a SPOPL-dependent manner, and accumulates with HRS in cells lacking SPOPL. Together, our data indicates that a CUL3-SPOPL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex regulates endocytic trafficking and MVB formation by ubiquitinating and degrading EPS15 at endosomes, thereby influencing influenza A virus infection as well as degradation of EGFR and other EPS15 targets.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13841"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13841"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13841","entryfile":"elife-13841-v2.xml","files":["elife-13841-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13841-v1.xml"]}
