Recent studies report that mice lacking glucagon receptor (<italic>Gcgr</italic>) do not develop diabetes following streptozotocin (STZ)-mediated ablation of insulin-producing β-cells. Here, we show that diabetes prevention in STZ-treated <italic>Gcgr</italic> animals requires remnant insulin action originating from spared residual β-cells: these mice indeed became hyperglycemic after insulin receptor blockade. Accordingly, <italic>Gcgr</italic> mice developed hyperglycemia after induction of a more complete, diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced β-cell loss, a situation of near-absolute insulin deficiency similar to type 1 diabetes. In addition, glucagon deficiency did not impair the natural capacity of α-cells to reprogram into insulin production after extreme β-cell loss. α-to-β-cell conversion was improved in <italic>Gcgr</italic> mice as a consequence of α-cell hyperplasia. Collectively, these results indicate that glucagon antagonism could i) be a useful adjuvant therapy in diabetes only when residual insulin action persists, and ii) help devising future β-cell regeneration therapies relying upon α-cell reprogramming.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13828"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13828"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13828","entryfile":"elife-13828-v2.xml","files":["elife-13828-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13828-v1.xml"]}
