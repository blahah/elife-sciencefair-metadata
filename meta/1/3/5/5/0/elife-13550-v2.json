Frequently co-opted to pattern new structures, the pathway is conserved among eumetazoans yet flexible and pleiotropic in its effects. The Hedgehog receptor, Patched, is transcriptionally activated by Hedgehog, providing essential negative feedback in all tissues. Our locus-wide dissections of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscapes of fly <italic>patched</italic> and mouse <italic>Ptch1</italic> reveal abundant, diverse enhancers with stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. The seemingly simple, constitutive Hedgehog response of <italic>patched/Ptch1</italic> is driven by a complex regulatory architecture, with batteries of context-specific enhancers engaged in promoter-specific interactions to tune signaling individually in each tissue, without disturbing patterning elsewhere. This structure—one of the oldest cis-regulatory features discovered in animal genomes—explains how <italic>patched/Ptch1</italic> can drive dramatic adaptations in animal morphology while maintaining its essential core function. It may also suggest a general model for the evolutionary flexibility of conserved regulators and pathways.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13550"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13550"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"13550","entryfile":"elife-13550-v2.xml","files":["elife-13550-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13550-v1.xml"]}
