The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that in the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following the activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13568"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13568"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13568","entryfile":"elife-13568-v2.xml","files":["elife-13568-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13568-v1.xml"]}
