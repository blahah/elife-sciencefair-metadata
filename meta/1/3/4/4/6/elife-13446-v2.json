The identification of pathways upon which p53-deficient cells depend could reveal therapeutic targets that may spare normal cells with intact p53. In contrast to P53 point mutations in other cancer, complete loss of P53 is a frequent event in osteosarcoma (OS), the most common cancer of bone. The consequences of p53 loss for osteoblastic cells and OS development are poorly understood. Here we use murine OS models to demonstrate that elevated <italic>Pthlh (Pthrp</italic>), cAMP levels and signalling via CREB1 are characteristic of both p53-deficient osteoblasts and OS. Normal osteoblasts survive depletion of both PTHrP and CREB1. In contrast, p53-deficient osteoblasts and OS depend upon continuous activation of this pathway and undergo proliferation arrest and apoptosis in the absence of PTHrP or CREB1. Our results identify the PTHrP-cAMP-CREB1 axis as an attractive pathway for therapeutic inhibition in OS.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13446"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13446"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13446","entryfile":"elife-13446-v2.xml","files":["elife-13446-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13446-v1.xml"]}
