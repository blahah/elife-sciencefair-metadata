We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1Î² production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop of NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS production and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host-cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13663"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13663"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13663","entryfile":"elife-13663-v2.xml","files":["elife-13663-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig14-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig15-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig16-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig17-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig18-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig19-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig20-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13663-v1.xml"]}
