It functions as a disulfide-tethered homodimer composed of three main domains, the Venus Flytrap module, cysteine-rich domain, and seven-helix transmembrane region. Here, we present the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaSR in the resting and active conformations. We provide direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation. Our structures reveal multiple binding sites for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. Both ions are crucial for structural integrity of the receptor. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions stabilize the active state, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions reinforce the inactive conformation. The activation mechanism of CaSR involves the formation of a novel dimer interface between subunits.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13662"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13662"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13662","entryfile":"elife-13662-v2.xml","files":["elife-13662-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13662-v1.xml"]}
