To survive, <italic>C. elegans</italic> dauer larvae and stationary phase <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> require elevated amounts of the disaccharide trehalose. We found that dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast switched into a gluconeogenic mode in which metabolism was reoriented toward production of sugars from non-carbohydrate sources. This mode depended on full activity of the glyoxylate shunt (GS), which enables synthesis of trehalose from acetate. The GS was especially critical during preparation of worms for harsh desiccation (preconditioning) and during the entry of yeast into stationary phase. Loss of the GS dramatically decreased desiccation tolerance in both organisms. Our results reveal a novel physiological role for the GS and elucidate a conserved metabolic rewiring that confers desiccation tolerance on organisms as diverse as worm and yeast.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13614"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13614"}],"date":{"day":"19","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13614","entryfile":"elife-13614-v2.xml","files":["elife-13614-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13614-v1.xml"]}
