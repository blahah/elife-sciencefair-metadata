However, the dynamic molecular processes involved make it difficult to correlate clustering with functional consequences in vivo. We developed a live-cell super-resolution approach to uncover the correlation between mRNA synthesis and the dynamics of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) clusters at a gene locus. For endogenous β-actin genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we observe that short-lived (~8 s) Pol II clusters correlate with basal mRNA output. During serum stimulation, a stereotyped increase in Pol II cluster lifetime correlates with a proportionate increase in the number of mRNAs synthesized. Our findings suggest that transient clustering of Pol II may constitute a pre-transcriptional regulatory event that predictably modulates nascent mRNA output.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13617"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13617"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13617","entryfile":"elife-13617-v2.xml","files":["elife-13617-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13617-v1.xml"]}
