However, it is unclear whether Munc13s function upstream and/or downstream of SNARE complex assembly, and how the actions of their multiple domains are integrated. Reconstitution, liposome-clustering and electrophysiological experiments now reveal a functional synergy between the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1, indicating that these domains help bridging the vesicle and plasma membranes to facilitate stimulation of SNARE complex assembly by the Munc13-1 MUN domain. Our reconstitution data also suggest that Munc18-1, Munc13-1, NSF, αSNAP and the SNAREs are critical to form a ‘primed’ state that does not fuse but is ready for fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Overall, our results support a model whereby the multiple domains of Munc13s cooperate to coordinate synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13696"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13696"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13696","entryfile":"elife-13696-v2.xml","files":["elife-13696-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13696-v1.xml"]}
