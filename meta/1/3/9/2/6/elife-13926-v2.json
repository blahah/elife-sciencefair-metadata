Due to their high levels of sequence identity and the existence of many polymorphic insertions absent from the reference genome, the transcriptional activation of individual genomic L1HS-Ta copies remains poorly understood. Here we comprehensively mapped fixed and polymorphic L1HS-Ta copies in 12 commonly-used somatic cell lines, and identified transcriptional and epigenetic signatures allowing the unambiguous identification of active L1HS-Ta copies in their genomic context. Strikingly, only a very restricted subset of L1HS-Ta loci - some being polymorphic among individuals - significantly contributes to the bulk of L1 expression, and these loci are differentially regulated among distinct cell lines. Thus, our data support a local model of L1 transcriptional activation in somatic cells, governed by individual-, locus-, and cell-type-specific determinants.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13926"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13926"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13926","entryfile":"elife-13926-v2.xml","files":["elife-13926-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13926-v1.xml"]}
