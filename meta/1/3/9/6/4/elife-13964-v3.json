From a screen for functionally relevant ERG interactors, we identify the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5. ERG recruits PRMT5 to AR-target genes, where PRMT5 methylates AR on arginine 761. This attenuates AR recruitment and transcription of genes expressed in differentiated prostate epithelium. The AR-inhibitory function of PRMT5 is restricted to <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic>-positive prostate cancer cells. Mutation of this methylation site on AR results in a transcriptionally hyperactive AR, suggesting that the proliferative effects of ERG and PRMT5 are mediated through attenuating ARâ€™s ability to induce genes normally involved in lineage differentiation. This provides a rationale for targeting PRMT5 in <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> positive prostate cancers. Moreover, methylation of AR at arginine 761 highlights a mechanism for how the ERG oncogene may coax AR towards inducing proliferation versus differentiation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13964"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13964"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13964","entryfile":"elife-13964-v3.xml","files":["elife-13964-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13964-v1.xml","elife-13964-v2.xml"]}
