The complex regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression, DNA damage repair and cell differentiation. HDACs 1 and 2 are recruited by the MTA1 corepressor to form the catalytic core of the complex. The histone chaperone protein RBBP4, has previously been shown to bind to the carboxy-terminal tail of MTA1. We show that MTA1 recruits a second copy of RBBP4. The crystal structure reveals an extensive interface between MTA1 and RBBP4. An EM structure, supported by SAXS and crosslinking, reveals the architecture of the dimeric HDAC1:MTA1:RBBP4 assembly which forms the core of the NuRD complex. We find evidence that in this complex RBBP4 mediates interaction with histone H3 tails, but not histone H4, suggesting a mechanism for recruitment of the NuRD complex to chromatin.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13941"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13941"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13941","entryfile":"elife-13941-v1.xml","files":["elife-13941-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13941-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
