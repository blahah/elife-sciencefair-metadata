Factors that function to harmonize growth with photoperiod are poorly understood. Here we characterize a new protein that associates with both circadian clock and photoreceptor components, named PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL1 (PCH1). <italic>pch1</italic> seedlings have overly elongated hypocotyls specifically under short days while constitutive expression of <italic>PCH1</italic> shortens hypocotyls independent of day length. PCH1 peaks at dusk, binds phytochrome B (phyB) in a red light-dependent manner, and co-localizes with phyB into photobodies. PCH1 is necessary and sufficient to promote the biogenesis of large photobodies to maintain an active phyB pool after light exposure, potentiating red-light signaling and prolonging memory of prior illumination. Manipulating PCH1 alters PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 levels and regulates light-responsive gene expression. Thus, PCH1 is a new factor that regulates photoperiod-responsive growth by integrating the clock with light perception pathways through modulating daily phyB-signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13292"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13292"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13292","entryfile":"elife-13292-v2.xml","files":["elife-13292-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13292-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13292-v1.xml"]}
