Reiterations of endothelial-tip-cell selection, sprout extension and anastomosis are the basis for vascular network generation, a process governed by the VEGF/Notch feedback loop. Here, we find that <italic>temporal</italic> regulation of this feedback loop, a previously unexplored dimension, is the key mechanism to determine vascular density. Iterating between <italic>computational</italic> modeling and in vivo live imaging, we demonstrate that the rate of tip-cell selection determines the length of linear sprout extension at the expense of branching, dictating network density. We provide the first example of a host tissue-derived signal (Semaphorin3E-Plexin-D1) that accelerates tip cell selection rate, yielding a dense network. We propose that <italic>temporal</italic> regulation of this critical, iterative aspect of network formation could be a general mechanism, and additional temporal regulators may exist to sculpt vascular topology.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13212"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13212"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13212","entryfile":"elife-13212-v3.xml","files":["elife-13212-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13212-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-13212-v1.xml","elife-13212-v2.xml"]}
