However, the role of gap junctions in insect cognition remains poorly understood. Using a flight simulator paradigm and genetic tools, we found that gap junctions are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kenyon cells (KCs), the major neurons of the mushroom bodies (MBs), and showed that they play an important role in visual learning and memory. Using a dye coupling approach, we determined the distribution of gap junctions in KCs. Furthermore, we identified a single pair of MB output neurons (MBONs) that possess a gap junction connection to KCs, and provide strong evidence that this connection is also required for visual learning and memory. Together, our results reveal gap junction networks in KCs and the KC-MBON circuit, and bring new insight into the synaptic network underlying flyâ€™s visual learning and memory.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13238"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13238"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"05","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13238","entryfile":"elife-13238-v2.xml","files":["elife-13238-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13238-v1.xml"]}
