{"title":"Nanoscale dynamics of synaptic vesicle trafficking and fusion at the presynaptic active zone","author":[{"surname":"Vaithianathan","given-names":"Thirumalini"},{"surname":"Henry","given-names":"Diane"},{"surname":"Akmentin","given-names":"Wendy"},{"surname":"Matthews","given-names":"Gary"}],"abstract":"The cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) is a macromolecular complex that facilitates the supply of release-ready synaptic vesicles to support neurotransmitter release at synapses. To reveal the dynamics of this supply process in living synapses, we used super-resolution imaging to track single vesicles at voltage-clamped presynaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons, whose CAZ contains a specialized structure—the synaptic ribbon—that supports both fast, transient and slow, sustained modes of transmission. We find that the synaptic ribbon serves a dual function as a conduit for diffusion of synaptic vesicles and a platform for vesicles to fuse distal to the plasma membrane itself, via compound fusion. The combination of these functions allows the ribbon-type CAZ to achieve the continuous transmitter release required by synapses of neurons that carry tonic, graded visual signals in the retina.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13245"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13245"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"02","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13245","entryfile":"elife-13245-v2.xml","files":["elife-13245-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13245-v1.xml"]}
