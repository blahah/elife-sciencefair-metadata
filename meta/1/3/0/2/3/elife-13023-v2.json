We show that the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is required in neurons and in OLs for normal CNS myelination. In mice, mutations of <italic>Fig4, Pikfyve</italic> or <italic>Vac14,</italic> encoding key components of the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosynthetic complex, each lead to impaired OL maturation, severe CNS hypomyelination and delayed propagation of compound action potentials. Primary OLs deficient in <italic>Fig4</italic> accumulate large LAMP1<sup>+</sup> and Rab7<sup>+</sup> vesicular structures and exhibit reduced membrane sheet expansion. PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> deficiency leads to accumulation of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) in LAMP1<sup>+</sup>perinuclear vesicles that fail to migrate to the nascent myelin sheet. Live-cell imaging of OLs after genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis revealed impaired trafficking of plasma membrane-derived MAG through the endolysosomal system in primary cells and brain tissue. Collectively, our studies identify PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> as a key regulator of myelin membrane trafficking and myelinogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13023"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13023"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"03","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13023","entryfile":"elife-13023-v2.xml","files":["elife-13023-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig8-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13023-v1.xml"]}
