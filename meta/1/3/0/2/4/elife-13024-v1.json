Here, we identify roles of Rev-erb nuclear receptors in regulating responses of mouse macrophages to complex tissue damage signals and wound repair. Rather than reinforcing a specific program of macrophage polarization, Rev-erbs repress subsets of genes that are activated by TLR ligands, IL4, TGFβ, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS). Unexpectedly, a complex damage signal promotes co-localization of NF-κB, Smad3, and Nrf2 at Rev-erb-sensitive enhancers and drives expression of genes characteristic of multiple polarization states in the same cells. Rev-erb-sensitive enhancers thereby integrate multiple damage-activated signaling pathways to promote a wound repair phenotype.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13024"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13024"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13024","entryfile":"elife-13024-v1.xml","files":["elife-13024-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13024-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
