Earlier studies using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have produced mixed results regarding the importance of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in human inhibitory versus excitatory neurons. We studied a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation (p.S1328P) identified in a pair of twins with Dravet Syndrome and generated iPSC-derived neurons from these patients. Characterization of the mutant channel revealed a decrease in current amplitude and hypersensitivity to steady-state inactivation. We then differentiated Dravet-Syndrome and control iPSCs into telencephalic excitatory neurons or medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like inhibitory neurons. Dravet inhibitory neurons showed deficits in sodium currents and action potential firing, which were rescued by a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 transgene, whereas Dravet excitatory neurons were normal. Our study identifies biophysical impairments underlying a deleterious Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation and supports the hypothesis that Dravet Syndrome arises from defective inhibitory neurons.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13073"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13073"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"07","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13073","entryfile":"elife-13073-v1.xml","files":["elife-13073-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13073-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg"]}
