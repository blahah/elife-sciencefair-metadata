Here we show that in <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> this receptor is instead expressed in the epimastigote developmental stage that occurs in the tsetse fly, where it acts as a haemoglobin receptor. We also present the structure of the <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor in complex with haemoglobin. This allows us to propose an evolutionary history for this receptor, charting the structural and cellular changes that took place as it adapted from a role in the insect to a new role in the mammalian host.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13044"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13044"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13044","entryfile":"elife-13044-v2.xml","files":["elife-13044-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-13044-v1.xml"]}
