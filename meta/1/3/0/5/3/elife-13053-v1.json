Currently, we do not know the importance of global protein localization nor do we understand to what extent the cell is permissive for new protein associations – a key requirement for the evolution of new protein functions. To answer this question, we fused every protein in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> with a partner from each of the major cellular compartments and quantitatively assessed the effects upon growth. This analysis reveals that cells have a remarkable and unanticipated tolerance for forced protein associations, even if these associations lead to a proportion of the protein moving compartments within the cell. Furthermore, the interactions that do perturb growth provide a functional map of spatial protein regulation, identifying key regulatory complexes for the normal homeostasis of eukaryotic cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"13053"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.13053"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"04","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"13053","entryfile":"elife-13053-v1.xml","files":["elife-13053-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig4-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-13053-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
