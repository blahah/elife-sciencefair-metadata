How the extent of gene conversions is regulated is unknown. Here we show that the budding yeast mismatch repair related MutLβ complex, Mlh1-Mlh2, specifically interacts with the conserved meiotic Mer3 helicase, which recruits it to recombination hotspots, independently of mismatch recognition. This recruitment is essential to limit gene conversion tract lengths genome-wide, without affecting crossover formation. Contrary to expectations, Mer3 helicase activity, proposed to extend the displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, does not influence the length of gene conversion events, revealing non-catalytical roles of Mer3. In addition, both purified Mer3 and MutLβ preferentially recognize D-loops, providing a mechanism for limiting gene conversion in vivo. These findings show that MutLβ is an integral part of a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination, which has implications to prevent rapid allele fixation and hotspot erosion in populations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21900"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21900"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21900","entryfile":"elife-21900-v1.xml","files":["elife-21900-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21900-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
