Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21907"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21907"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21907","entryfile":"elife-21907-v2.xml","files":["elife-21907-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21907-v1.xml"]}
