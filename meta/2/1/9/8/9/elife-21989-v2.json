{"title":"Cooperative and acute inhibition by multiple C-terminal motifs of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels","author":[{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Nan"},{"surname":"Yang","given-names":"Yaxiong"},{"surname":"Ge","given-names":"Lin"},{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Min"},{"surname":"Colecraft","given-names":"Henry M"},{"surname":"Liu","given-names":"Xiaodong"}],"abstract":"Inhibitions and antagonists of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are important to both research and therapeutics. Here, we report C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 that multiple motifs coordinate to tune down Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx toward the lower limits determined by end-stage CDI (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation). Among IQ<sub>V</sub> (preIQ<sub>3</sub>-IQ domain), PCRD and DCRD (proximal or distal C-terminal regulatory domain), spatial closeness of any two modules, <italic>e.g.</italic>, by constitutive fusion, facilitates the trio to form the complex, compete against calmodulin, and alter the gating. Acute CMI by rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization helps reconcile the concurrent activation/inactivation attenuations to ensure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reduced, in that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current activated by depolarization is potently (~65%) inhibited at the peak (full activation), but not later on (end-stage inactivation, ~300 ms). Meanwhile, CMI provides a new paradigm to develop Ca<sub>V</sub>1 inhibitors, the therapeutic potential of which is implied by computational modeling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dysregulations related to Parkinsonâ€™s disease.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21989"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21989"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21989","entryfile":"elife-21989-v2.xml","files":["elife-21989-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21989-v1.xml"]}
