In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a single pair of replisomes is responsible for duplicating the entire 4.6 Mbp circular chromosome (Beattie and Reyes-Lamothe, 2015). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies of reconstituted <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes have attributed this remarkable processivity to the high stability of the replisome once assembled on DNA (Tanner et al., 2011, Yao et al., 2009, Kim et al., 1996b). By examining replisomes in live <italic>E. coli</italic> with fluorescence microscopy, we found that the Pol III* subassembly frequently disengages from the replisome during DNA synthesis and exchanges with free copies from solution. In contrast, the DnaB helicase associates stably with the replication fork, providing the molecular basis for how the <italic>E. coli</italic> replisome can maintain high processivity and yet possess the flexibility to bypass obstructions in template DNA. Our data challenges the widely-accepted semi-discontinuous model of chromosomal replication, instead supporting a fully discontinuous mechanism in which synthesis of both leading and lagging strands is frequently interrupted.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21763"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21763"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21763","entryfile":"elife-21763-v1.xml","files":[]}
