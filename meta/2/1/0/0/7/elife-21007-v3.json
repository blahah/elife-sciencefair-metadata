It requires recruitment of outer kinetochore microtubule binders by centromere proteins C and T (CENP-C and CENP-T). To study the molecular requirements of kinetochore formation, we reconstituted the binding of the MIS12 and NDC80 outer kinetochore subcomplexes to CENP-C and CENP-T. Whereas CENP-C recruits a single MIS12:NDC80 complex, we show here that CENP-T binds one MIS12:NDC80 and two NDC80 complexes upon phosphorylation by the mitotic CDK1:Cyclin B complex at three distinct CENP-T sites. Visualization of reconstituted complexes by electron microscopy supports this model. Binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12 is competitive, and therefore CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit two MIS12 and up to four NDC80 complexes. Our observations provide a molecular explanation for the stoichiometry of kinetochore components and its cell cycle regulation, and highlight how outer kinetochore modules bridge distances of well over 100 nm.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21007"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21007"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21007","entryfile":"elife-21007-v3.xml","files":["elife-21007-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig3-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig4-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig6-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21007-v1.xml","elife-21007-v2.xml"]}
