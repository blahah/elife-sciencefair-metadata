{"title":"Stimulus-dependent recruitment of lateral inhibition underlies retinal direction selectivity","author":[{"surname":"Chen","given-names":"Qiang"},{"surname":"Pei","given-names":"Zhe"},{"surname":"Koren","given-names":"David"},{"surname":"Wei","given-names":"Wei"}],"abstract":"The dendrites of starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the mammalian retina are preferentially activated by motion in the centrifugal direction, a property that is important for generating direction selectivity in direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). A candidate mechanism underlying the centrifugal direction selectivity of SAC dendrites is synaptic inhibition onto SACs. Here we disrupted this inhibition by perturbing distinct sets of GABAergic inputs onto SACs â€“ removing either GABA release or GABA receptors from SACs. We found that lateral inhibition onto Off SACs from non-SAC amacrine cells is required for optimal direction selectivity of the Off pathway. In contrast, lateral inhibition onto On SACs is not necessary for direction selectivity of the On pathway when the moving object is on a homogenous background, but is required when the background is noisy. These results demonstrate that distinct sets of inhibitory mechanisms are recruited to generate direction selectivity under different visual conditions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21053"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21053"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21053","entryfile":"elife-21053-v2.xml","files":["elife-21053-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21053-v1.xml"]}
