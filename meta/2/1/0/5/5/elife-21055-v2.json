Here, we report that peripheral administration of the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin improves the survival of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxin shock, a well-studied septic shock model. The effect is accompanied by a suppression of excessive cytokine production and an increase of catecholamines and corticosterone. We found that peripherally administered orexin penetrates the blood-brain barrier under endotoxin shock, and that central administration of orexin also suppresses the cytokine production and improves the survival, indicating orexinâ€™s direct action in the central nervous system (CNS). Orexin helps restore body temperature and potentiates cardiovascular function in LPS-injected mice. Pleiotropic modulation of inflammatory response by orexin through the CNS may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for septic shock.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21055"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21055"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21055","entryfile":"elife-21055-v2.xml","files":["elife-21055-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21055-v1.xml"]}
