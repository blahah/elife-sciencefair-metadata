Here we characterize lobula columnar (LC) cells, a class of <italic>Drosophila</italic> VPNs that project to distinct central brain structures called optic glomeruli. We anatomically describe 22 different LC types and show that, for several types, optogenetic activation in freely moving flies evokes specific behaviors. The activation phenotypes of two LC types closely resemble natural avoidance behaviors triggered by a visual loom. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging reveals that these LC types respond to looming stimuli, while another type does not, but instead responds to the motion of a small object. Activation of LC neurons on only one side of the brain can result in attractive or aversive turning behaviors depending on the cell type. Our results indicate that LC neurons convey information on the presence and location of visual features relevant for specific behaviors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21022"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21022"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21022","entryfile":"elife-21022-v2.xml","files":["elife-21022-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig10-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig11-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig12-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig13-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21022-v1.xml"]}
