These parasites invade erythrocytes, a complex process involving multiple ligand-receptor interactions. The parasite makes initial contact with the erythrocyte followed by dramatic deformations linked to the function of the Erythrocyte binding antigen family and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reticulocyte binding-like families. We show EBA-175 mediates substantial changes in the deformability of erythrocytes by binding to glycophorin A and activating a phosphorylation cascade that includes erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins resulting in changes in the viscoelastic properties of the host cell. TRPM7 kinase inhibitors FTY720 and waixenicin A block the changes in the deformability of erythrocytes and inhibit merozoite invasion by directly inhibiting the phosphorylation cascade. Therefore, binding of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites to the erythrocyte directly activate a signaling pathway through a phosphorylation cascade and this alters the viscoelastic properties of the host membrane conditioning it for successful invasion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21083"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21083"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21083","entryfile":"elife-21083-v3.xml","files":["elife-21083-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21083-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21083-v1.xml","elife-21083-v2.xml"]}
