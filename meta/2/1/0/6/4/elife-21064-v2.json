Here, we demonstrate that PCGF6-PRC1 plays a role in repressing a subset of PRC1 target genes by recruiting RING1B and mediating downstream mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A. PCGF6-PRC1 bound loci are highly enriched for promoters of germ cell-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Conditional ablation of <italic>Pcgf6</italic> in ESCs leads to robust de-repression of such germ cell-related genes, in turn affecting cell growth and viability. We also find a role for PCGF6 in pre- and peri-implantation mouse embryonic development. We further show that a heterodimer of the transcription factors MAX and MGA recruits PCGF6 to target loci. PCGF6 thus links sequence specific target recognition by the MAX/MGA complex to PRC1-dependent transcriptional silencing of germ cell-specific genes in pluripotent stem cells.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21064"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21064"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21064","entryfile":"elife-21064-v2.xml","files":["elife-21064-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21064-v1.xml"]}
