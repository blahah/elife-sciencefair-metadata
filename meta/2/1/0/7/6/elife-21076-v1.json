LTE induction requires activation of at least three signaling pathways to the MBs, mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), NMDA receptors (NRs), and D1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs). Here, we demonstrate that inputs from the AL are transmitted to the MBs through nAChRs, and inputs from the AFV are transmitted by NRs. Dopamine signaling occurs downstream of both nAChR and NR activation, and requires simultaneous stimulation of both pathways. Dopamine release requires the activity of the rutabaga adenylyl cyclase in postsynaptic MB neurons, and release is restricted to MB neurons that receive coincident stimulation. Our results indicate that postsynaptic activity can gate presynaptic dopamine release to regulate plasticity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21076"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21076"}],"date":{"day":"24","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21076","entryfile":"elife-21076-v1.xml","files":["elife-21076-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21076-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
