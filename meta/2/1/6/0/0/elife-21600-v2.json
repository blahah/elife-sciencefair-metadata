{"title":"Crenactin forms actin-like double helical filaments regulated by arcadin-2","author":[{"surname":"Izoré","given-names":"Thierry"},{"surname":"Kureisaite-Ciziene","given-names":"Danguole"},{"surname":"McLaughlin","given-names":"Stephen H"},{"surname":"Löwe","given-names":"Jan"}],"abstract":"The similarity of eukaryotic actin to crenactin, a filament-forming protein from the crenarchaeon <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic> supports the theory of a common origin of Crenarchaea and Eukaryotes. Monomeric structures of crenactin and actin are similar, although their filament architectures were suggested to be different. Here we report that crenactin forms <italic>bona fide</italic> double helical filaments that show exceptional similarity to eukaryotic F-actin. With cryo-electron microscopy and helical reconstruction we solved the structure of the crenactin filament to 3.8 Å resolution. When forming double filaments, the 'hydrophobic plug' loop in crenactin rearranges. Arcadin-2, also encoded by the arcade gene cluster, binds tightly with its C-terminus to the hydrophobic groove of crenactin. Binding is reminiscent of eukaryotic actin modulators such as cofilin and thymosin β4 and arcadin-2 is a depolymeriser of crenactin filaments. Our work further supports the theory of shared ancestry of Eukaryotes and Crenarchaea.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21600"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21600"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21600","entryfile":"elife-21600-v2.xml","files":["elife-21600-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21600-v1.xml"]}
