Pathway choice is made at the level of DNA end resection, a nucleolytic processing step, which primes DSBs for repair by recombination. Resection is thus under cell cycle control, but additionally regulated by chromatin and nucleosome remodellers. Here, we show that both layers of control converge in the regulation of resection by the evolutionarily conserved Fun30/SMARCAD1 remodeller. Budding yeast Fun30 and human SMARCAD1 are cell cycle-regulated by interaction with the DSB-localized scaffold protein Dpb11/TOPBP1, respectively. In yeast, this protein assembly additionally comprises the 9-1-1 damage sensor, is involved in localizing Fun30 to damaged chromatin, and thus is required for efficient long-range resection of DSBs. Notably, artificial targeting of Fun30 to DSBs is sufficient to bypass the cell cycle regulation of long-range resection, indicating that chromatin remodelling during resection is underlying DSB repair pathway choice.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21687"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21687"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21687","entryfile":"elife-21687-v3.xml","files":["elife-21687-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig1-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig9-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig9-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig9-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig9-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig9-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig9-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21687-v1.xml","elife-21687-v2.xml"]}
