Here, we show that the chlamydial deubiquitinating enzyme (Cdu) 1 localizes in the inclusion membrane and faces the cytosol with the active deubiquitinating enzyme domain. The structure of this domain revealed high similarity to mammalian deubiquitinases with a unique α-helix close to the substrate-binding pocket. We identified the apoptosis regulator Mcl-1 as a target that interacts with Cdu1 and is stabilized by deubiquitination at the chlamydial inclusion. A chlamydial transposon insertion mutant in the Cdu1-encoding gene exhibited increased Mcl-1 and inclusion ubiquitination and reduced Mcl-1 stabilization. Additionally, inactivation of Cdu1 led to increased sensitivity of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> for IFNγ and impaired infection in mice. Thus, the chlamydial inclusion serves as an enriched site for a deubiquitinating activity exerting a function in selective stabilization of host proteins and protection from host defense.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21465"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21465"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21465","entryfile":"elife-21465-v1.xml","files":["elife-21465-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21465-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
