{"title":"Chronic social isolation reduces 5-HT neuronal activity via upregulated SK3 calcium-activated potassium channels","author":[{"surname":"Sargin","given-names":"Derya"},{"surname":"Oliver","given-names":"David K"},{"surname":"Lambe","given-names":"Evelyn K"}],"abstract":"The activity of serotonin (5-HT) neurons is critical for mood regulation. In a mouse model of chronic social isolation, a known risk factor for depressive illness, we show that 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus are less responsive to stimulation. Probing the responsible cellular mechanisms pinpoints a disturbance in the expression and function of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels and reveals an important role for both SK2 and SK3 channels in normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability. Chronic social isolation renders 5-HT neurons insensitive to SK2 blockade, however inhibition of the upregulated SK3 channels restores normal excitability. In vivo, we demonstrate that inhibiting SK channels normalizes chronic social isolation-induced anxiety/depressive-like behaviors. Our experiments reveal a causal link for the first time between SK channel dysregulation and 5-HT neuron activity in a lifelong stress paradigm, suggesting these channels as targets for the development of novel therapies for mood disorders.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21416"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21416"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21416","entryfile":"elife-21416-v1.xml","files":["elife-21416-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21416-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21416-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21416-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21416-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21416-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21416-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21416-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
