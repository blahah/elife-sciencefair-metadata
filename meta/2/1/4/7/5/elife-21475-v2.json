{"title":"In vivo vizualisation of mono-ADP-ribosylation by dPARP16 upon amino-acid starvation","author":[{"surname":"Aguilera-Gomez","given-names":"Angelica"},{"surname":"van Oorschot","given-names":"Marinke M"},{"surname":"Veenendaal","given-names":"Tineke"},{"surname":"Rabouille","given-names":"Catherine"}],"abstract":"PARP catalysed ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification involved in several physiological and pathological processes, including cellular stress. In order to visualise both Poly-, and Mono-, ADP-ribosylation in vivo, we engineered specific fluorescent probes. Using them, we show that amino-acid starvation triggers an unprecedented display of mono-ADP-ribosylation that governs the formation of Sec body, a recently identified stress assembly that forms in Drosophila cells. We show that dPARP16 catalytic activity is necessary and sufficient for both amino-acid starvation induced mono-ADP-ribosylation and subsequent Sec body formation and cell survival. Importantly, dPARP16 catalyses the modification of Sec16, a key Sec body component, and we show that it is a critical event for the formation of this stress assembly. Taken together our findings establish a novel example for the role of mono-ADP-ribosylation in the formation of stress assemblies, and link this modification to a metabolic stress.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21475"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21475"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21475","entryfile":"elife-21475-v2.xml","files":["elife-21475-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21475-v1.xml"]}
