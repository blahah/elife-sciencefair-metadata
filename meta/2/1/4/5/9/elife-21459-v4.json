To discover regulatory mechanisms in canonical WNT signaling, we conducted a systematic forward genetic analysis through reporter-based screens in haploid human cells. Comparison of screens for negative, attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling, mediators of R-spondin-dependent signaling and suppressors of constitutive signaling induced by loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli or casein kinase 1α uncovered new regulatory features at most levels of the pathway. These include a requirement for the transcription factor AP-4, a role for the DAX domain of AXIN2 in controlling β-catenin transcriptional activity, a contribution of glycophosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and glypicans to R-spondin-potentiated WNT signaling, and two different mechanisms that regulate signaling when distinct components of the β-catenin destruction complex are lost. The conceptual and methodological framework we describe should enable the comprehensive understanding of other signaling systems.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21459"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21459"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21459","entryfile":"elife-21459-v4.xml","files":["elife-21459-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig1-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig4-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21459-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21459-v1.xml","elife-21459-v2.xml","elife-21459-v3.xml"]}
