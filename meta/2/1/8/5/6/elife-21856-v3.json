{"title":"An efficient targeted nuclease strategy for high-resolution mapping of DNA binding sites","author":[{"surname":"Skene","given-names":"Peter J"},{"surname":"Henikoff","given-names":"Steven"}],"abstract":"We describe Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), a chromatin profiling strategy in which antibody-targeted controlled cleavage by micrococcal nuclease releases specific protein-DNA complexes into the supernatant for paired-end DNA sequencing. Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which fragments and solubilizes total chromatin, CUT&RUN is performed in situ, allowing for both quantitative high-resolution chromatin mapping and probing of the local chromatin environment. When applied to yeast and human nuclei, CUT&RUN yielded precise transcription factor profiles while avoiding crosslinking and solubilization issues. CUT&RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT&RUN mapped directional long range contact sites at high resolution. We conclude that in situ mapping of protein-DNA interactions by CUT&RUN is an attractive alternative to ChIP-seq.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21856"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21856"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21856","entryfile":"elife-21856-v3.xml","files":["elife-21856-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig6-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21856-v1.xml","elife-21856-v2.xml"]}
