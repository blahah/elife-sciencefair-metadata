{"title":"Coincidence detection and bi-directional transmembrane signaling control a bacterial second messenger receptor","author":[{"surname":"Cooley","given-names":"Richard B"},{"surname":"O’Donnell","given-names":"John P"},{"surname":"Sondermann","given-names":"Holger"}],"abstract":"The second messenger c-di-GMP (or cyclic diguanylate) regulates biofilm formation, a physiological adaptation process in bacteria, via a widely conserved signaling node comprising a prototypical transmembrane receptor for c-di-GMP, LapD, and a cognate periplasmic protease, LapG. Previously, we reported a structure-function study of a soluble LapD•LapG complex, which established conformational changes in the receptor that lead to c-di-GMP-dependent protease recruitment (Chatterjee et al., 2014). This work also revealed a basal affinity of c-di-GMP-unbound receptor for LapG, the relevance of which remained enigmatic. Here, we elucidate the structural basis of coincidence detection that relies on both c-di-GMP and LapG binding to LapD for receptor activation. The data indicate that high-affinity for LapG relies on the formation of a receptor dimer-of-dimers, rather than a simple conformational change within dimeric LapD. The proposed mechanism provides a rationale of how external proteins can regulate receptor function and may also apply to c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes that are akin to LapD.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21848"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21848"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21848","entryfile":"elife-21848-v2.xml","files":["elife-21848-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21848-v1.xml"]}
