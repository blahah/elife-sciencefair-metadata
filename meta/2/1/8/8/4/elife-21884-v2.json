Yet, it is unclear how the 5’nuclease mechanisms of DNA distortion and protein ordering robustly mediate efficient and accurate substrate recognition and catalytic selectivity. Here, single-molecule sub-millisecond and millisecond analyses of FEN1 reveal a protein-DNA induced-fit mechanism that efficiently verifies substrate and suppresses off-target cleavage. FEN1 sculpts DNA with diffusion-limited kinetics to test DNA substrate. This DNA distortion mutually ‘locks’ protein and DNA conformation and enables substrate verification with extreme precision. Strikingly, FEN1 never misses cleavage of its cognate substrate while blocking probable formation of catalytically competent interactions with noncognate substrates and fostering their pre-incision dissociation. These findings establish FEN1 has practically perfect precision and that separate control of induced-fit substrate recognition sets up the catalytic selectivity of the nuclease active site for genome stability.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21884"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21884"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21884","entryfile":"elife-21884-v2.xml","files":["elife-21884-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21884-v1.xml"]}
