{"title":"Opposite initialization to novel cues in dopamine signaling in ventral and posterior striatum in mice","author":[{"surname":"Menegas","given-names":"William"},{"surname":"Babayan","given-names":"Benedicte M"},{"surname":"Uchida","given-names":"Naoshige"},{"surname":"Watabe-Uchida","given-names":"Mitsuko"}],"abstract":"Dopamine neurons are thought to encode novelty in addition to reward prediction error (the discrepancy between actual and predicted values). In this study, we compared dopamine activity across the striatum using fiber fluorometry in mice. During classical conditioning, we observed opposite dynamics in dopamine axon signals in the ventral striatum (‘VS dopamine’) and the posterior tail of the striatum (‘TS dopamine’). TS dopamine showed strong excitation to novel cues, whereas VS dopamine showed no responses to novel cues until they had been paired with a reward. TS dopamine cue responses decreased over time, depending on what the cue predicted. Additionally, TS dopamine showed excitation to several types of stimuli including rewarding, aversive, and neutral stimuli whereas VS dopamine showed excitation only to reward or reward-predicting cues. Together, these results demonstrate that dopamine novelty signals are localized in TS along with general salience signals, while VS dopamine reliably encodes reward prediction error.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21886"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21886"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21886","entryfile":"elife-21886-v2.xml","files":["elife-21886-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21886-v1.xml"]}
