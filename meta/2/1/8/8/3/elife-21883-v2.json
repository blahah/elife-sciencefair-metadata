Here, we define chromatin accessibility landscapes of major, layer-specific excitatory classes of neurons, and compare them to each other and to inhibitory cortical neurons using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). We identify a large number of layer-specific accessible sites, and significant association with genes that are expressed in specific cortical layers. Integration of these data with layer-specific transcriptomic profiles and transcription factor binding motifs enabled us to construct a regulatory network revealing potential key layer-specific regulators, including <italic>Cux1/2</italic>, <italic>Foxp2</italic>, <italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Pou3f2</italic>, and <italic>Rorb</italic>. This dataset is a valuable resource for identifying candidate layer-specific cis-regulatory elements in adult mouse cortex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21883"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21883"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21883","entryfile":"elife-21883-v2.xml","files":["elife-21883-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21883-v1.xml"]}
