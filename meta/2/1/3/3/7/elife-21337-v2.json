The molecular mechanisms that regulate the spatial distribution of RNA granules in cells are poorly understood. During polarization of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote, germline RNA granules, called P granules, assemble preferentially in the posterior cytoplasm. We present evidence that P granule asymmetry depends on RNA-induced phase separation of the granule scaffold MEG-3. MEG-3 is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds and phase separates with RNA in vitro. In vivo, MEG-3 forms a posterior-rich concentration gradient that is anti-correlated with a gradient in the RNA-binding protein MEX-5. MEX-5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress MEG-3 granule formation in vivo, and suppresses RNA-induced MEG-3 phase separation in vitro. Our findings suggest that MEX-5 interferes with MEG-3â€™s access to RNA, thus locally suppressing MEG-3 phase separation to drive P granule asymmetry. Regulated access to RNA, combined with RNA-induced phase separation of key scaffolding proteins, may be a general mechanism for controlling the formation of RNA granules in space and time.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21337"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21337"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21337","entryfile":"elife-21337-v2.xml","files":["elife-21337-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21337-v1.xml"]}
