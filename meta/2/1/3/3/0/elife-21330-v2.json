Although Otto Warburg first described aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells >90 years ago, the primary purpose of this metabolic switch remains controversial. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway requires glucose and glutamine for de novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, a sugar-nucleotide that inhibits receptor endocytosis and signaling by promoting N-acetylglucosamine branching of Asn (N)-linked glycans. Here, we report that aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis co-operatively reduce UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis and N-glycan branching in mouse T cell blasts by starving the hexosamine pathway of glucose and glutamine. This drives growth and pro-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 over anti-inflammatory-induced T regulatory (iTreg) differentiation, the latter by promoting endocytic loss of IL-2 receptor-Î± (CD25). Thus, a primary function of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis is to co-operatively limit metabolite supply to N-glycan biosynthesis, an activity with widespread implications for autoimmunity and cancer.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21330"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21330"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21330","entryfile":"elife-21330-v2.xml","files":["elife-21330-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21330-v1.xml"]}
