Achieving accuracy is challenging, as the molecular signals that dictate a proteinâ€™s cellular destination are often promiscuous. A salient example is the targeting of an essential class of tail-anchored (TA) proteins, whose sole defining feature is a transmembrane domain near their C-terminus. Here we show that the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway selects TA proteins destined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) utilizing distinct molecular steps, including differential binding by the co-chaperone Sgt2 and kinetic proofreading after ATP hydrolysis by the targeting factor Get3. Further, the different steps select for distinct physicochemical features of the TA substrate. The use of multiple selection filters may be general to protein biogenesis pathways that must distinguish correct and incorrect substrates based on minor differences.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21301"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21301"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21301","entryfile":"elife-21301-v2.xml","files":["elife-21301-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21301-v1.xml"]}
