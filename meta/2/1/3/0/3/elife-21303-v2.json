The expression of <italic>Paired-homeobox 6 (PAX6)</italic> is regulated by multiple cis-DNA elements including the intronic α-enhancer, which is active in GABAergic amacrine cell subsets. Here, we report that the transforming growth factor ß1-induced transcript 1 protein (Tgfb1i1) interacts with the LIM domain transcription factors Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the α-enhancer in the post-natal mouse retina. <italic>Tgfb1i1</italic> mice show elevated α-enhancer activity leading to overproduction of Pax6ΔPD isoform that supports the GABAergic amacrine cell fate maintenance. Consequently, the <italic>Tgfb1i1</italic> mouse retinas show a sustained light response, which becomes more transient in mice with the auto-stimulation-defective <italic>Pax6</italic> mutation. Together, we show the antagonistic regulation of the α-enhancer activity by Pax6 and the LIM protein complex is necessary for the establishment of an inner retinal circuitry, which controls visual adaptation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21303"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21303"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21303","entryfile":"elife-21303-v2.xml","files":["elife-21303-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21303-v1.xml"]}
