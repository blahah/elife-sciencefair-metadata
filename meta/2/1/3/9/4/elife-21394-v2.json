Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. With an original modelling approach, calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots (175 ha total) across Amazonia, we link regional differences in climate, soil and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery. We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west (21 <inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula>3 Mg C ha<inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula>) than in the south (12 <inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula>3 Mg C ha<inline-formula>undefined</inline-formula>) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21394"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21394"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21394","entryfile":"elife-21394-v2.xml","files":["elife-21394-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-app1-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21394-v1.xml"]}
