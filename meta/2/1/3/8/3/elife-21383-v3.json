Unlike actomyosin in sarcomeres, which cycles through contraction and relaxation, the cytokinetic ring disassembles during contraction through an unknown mechanism. Here we find in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> that, during actomyosin ring contraction, actin filaments associated with actomyosin rings are expelled as micron-scale bundles containing multiple actomyosin ring proteins. Using functional isolated actomyosin rings we show that expulsion of actin bundles does not require continuous presence of cytoplasm. Strikingly, mechanical compression of actomyosin rings results in expulsion of bundles predominantly at regions of high curvature. Our work unprecedentedly reveals that the increased curvature of the ring itself promotes its disassembly. It is likely that such a curvature-induced mechanism may operate in disassembly of other contractile networks.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21383"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21383"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21383","entryfile":"elife-21383-v3.xml","files":["elife-21383-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21383-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21383-v1.xml","elife-21383-v2.xml"]}
