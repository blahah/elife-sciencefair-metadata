Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21221"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21221"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21221","entryfile":"elife-21221-v2.xml","files":["elife-21221-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21221-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21221-v1.xml"]}
