Here we reveal that IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells are constrained by chronic activity of the IgE B cell receptor (BCR). In the absence of cognate antigen, the IgE BCR promoted terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (PCs) under cell culture conditions mimicking T cell help. This antigen-independent PC differentiation involved multiple IgE domains and Syk, CD19, BLNK, Btk, and IRF4. Disruption of BCR signaling in mice led to consistently exaggerated IgE<sup>+</sup> germinal center (GC) B cell but variably increased PC responses. We were unable to confirm reports that the IgE BCR directly promoted intrinsic apoptosis. Instead, IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells exhibited poor antigen presentation and prolonged cell cycles, suggesting reduced competition for T cell help. We propose that chronic BCR activity and access to T cell help play critical roles in regulating IgE responses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21238"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21238"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21238","entryfile":"elife-21238-v2.xml","files":["elife-21238-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21238-v1.xml"]}
