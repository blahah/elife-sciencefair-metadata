However, during starvation-induced stress, COPII vesicles have been implicated as a membrane source for autophagosomes, distinct organelles that engulf cellular components for degradation by macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy). How cells regulate core trafficking machinery to fulfill dramatically different cellular roles in response to environmental cues is unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of conserved amino acids on the membrane-distal surface of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> COPII cargo adaptor, Sec24, reprograms COPII vesicles for autophagy. We also show casein kinase 1 (Hrr25) is a key kinase that phosphorylates this regulatory surface. During autophagy, Sec24 phosphorylation regulates autophagosome number and its interaction with the C-terminus of Atg9, a component of the autophagy machinery required for autophagosome initiation. We propose that the acute need to produce autophagosomes during starvation drives the interaction of Sec24 with Atg9 to increase autophagosome abundance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21167"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21167"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21167","entryfile":"elife-21167-v2.xml","files":["elife-21167-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig5-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig5-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig6-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21167-v1.xml"]}
