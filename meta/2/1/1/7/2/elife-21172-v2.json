During heart tube assembly, interactions with the adjacent endoderm control the medial movement of cardiomyocytes, a process referred to as cardiac fusion. However, the molecular underpinnings of this endodermal-myocardial relationship remain unclear. Here, we show an essential role for platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) in directing cardiac fusion. Mutation of <italic>pdgfra</italic> disrupts heart tube assembly in both zebrafish and mouse. Timelapse analysis of individual cardiomyocyte trajectories reveals misdirected cells in zebrafish <italic>pdgfra</italic> mutants, suggesting that PDGF signaling steers cardiomyocytes toward the midline during cardiac fusion. Intriguingly, the ligand <italic>pdgfaa</italic> is expressed in the endoderm medial to the <italic>pdgfra</italic>-expressing myocardial precursors. Ectopic expression of <italic>pdgfaa</italic> interferes with cardiac fusion, consistent with an instructive role for PDGF signaling. Together, these data uncover a novel mechanism through which endodermal-myocardial communication can guide the cell movements that initiate cardiac morphogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21172"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21172"}],"date":{"day":"18","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21172","entryfile":"elife-21172-v2.xml","files":["elife-21172-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21172-v1.xml"]}
