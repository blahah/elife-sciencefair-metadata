We now show, using α<sub>2</sub>δ constructs containing artificial cleavage sites, that this processing is an essential step permitting voltage-dependent activation of plasma membrane N-type (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2) calcium channels. Indeed, uncleaved α2δ inhibits native calcium currents in mammalian neurons. By inducing acute cell-surface proteolytic cleavage of α<sub>2</sub>δ, voltage-dependent activation of channels is promoted, independent from the trafficking role of α<sub>2</sub>δ. Uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ does not support trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channel complexes into neuronal processes, and inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into synaptic boutons, and we can reverse this by controlled intracellular proteolytic cleavage. We propose a model whereby uncleaved α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits maintain immature calcium channels in an inhibited state. Proteolytic processing of α<sub>2</sub>δ then permits voltage-dependent activation of the channels, acting as a checkpoint allowing trafficking only of mature calcium channel complexes into neuronal processes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21143"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21143"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21143","entryfile":"elife-21143-v3.xml","files":["elife-21143-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21143-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21143-v1.xml","elife-21143-v2.xml"]}
