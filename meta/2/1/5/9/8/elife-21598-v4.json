Three different states that relate to rotation of the enzyme were observed, with the central stalk’s ε subunit in an extended autoinhibitory conformation in all three states. The F<sub>o</sub> motor comprises of seven transmembrane helices and a decameric c-ring and invaginations on either side of the membrane indicate the entry and exit channels for protons. The proton translocating subunit contains near parallel helices inclined by ~30° to the membrane, a feature now synonymous with rotary ATPases. For the first time in this rotary ATPase subtype, the peripheral stalk is resolved over its entire length of the complex, revealing the F<sub>1</sub> attachment points and a coiled-coil that bifurcates toward the membrane with its helices separating to embrace subunit <italic>a</italic> from two sides.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21598"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21598"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21598","entryfile":"elife-21598-v4.xml","files":["elife-21598-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp10-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp10-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-figsupp9-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig3-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-figsupp5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-21598-resp-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-21598-v1.xml","elife-21598-v2.xml","elife-21598-v3.xml"]}
