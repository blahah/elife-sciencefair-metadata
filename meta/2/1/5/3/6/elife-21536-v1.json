We used FGF-receptor signaling to identify <italic>EGR1</italic> as a locus that strongly responds to the activation of a majority of the recognized protein kinase oncogenes, including 30 receptor tyrosine kinases and 154 of their disease-associated mutants. The <italic>EGR1</italic> promoter was engineered to enhance <italic>trans</italic>-activation capacity and optimized for simple screening assays with luciferase or fluorescent reporters. The efficacy of the developed, fully synthetic reporters was demonstrated by the identification of novel targets for two clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nilotinib and osimertinib. A universal reporter system for in-cell protein kinase profiling will facilitate repurposing of existing anti-cancer drugs and identification of novel inhibitors in high-throughput screening studies.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21536"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21536"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21536","entryfile":"elife-21536-v1.xml","files":["elife-21536-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-21536-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg"]}
