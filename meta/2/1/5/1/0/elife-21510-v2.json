{"title":"Structural insights into the mechanism of the DEAH-box RNA helicase Prp43","author":[{"surname":"Tauchert","given-names":"Marcel J"},{"surname":"Fourmann","given-names":"Jean-Baptiste"},{"surname":"Lührmann","given-names":"Reinhard"},{"surname":"Ficner","given-names":"Ralf"}],"abstract":"The DEAH-box helicase Prp43 is a key player in pre-mRNA splicing as well as the maturation of rRNAs. The exact <italic>modus operandi</italic> of Prp43 and of all other spliceosomal DEAH-box RNA helicases is still elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of Prp43 complexes in different functional states and the analysis of structure-based mutants providing insights into the unwinding and loading mechanism of RNAs. The Prp43•ATP-analog•RNA complex shows the localization of the RNA inside a tunnel formed by the two RecA-like and C-terminal domains. In the ATP-bound state this tunnel can be transformed into a groove prone for RNA binding by large rearrangements of the C-terminal domains. Several conformational changes between the ATP- and ADP-bound states explain the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation, mainly mediated by a β-turn of the RecA1 domain containing the newly identified RF motif. This mechanism is clearly different to those of other RNA helicases.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"21510"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.21510"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"21510","entryfile":"elife-21510-v2.xml","files":["elife-21510-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-21510-v1.xml"]}
