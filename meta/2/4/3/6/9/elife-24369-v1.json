Perivascular cells surrounding brain blood vessels are thought to be important for blood-brain barrier establishment, but their roles are not well defined. Here, we describe a novel perivascular cell population closely associated with blood vessels on the zebrafish brain. Based on similarities in their morphology, location, and scavenger behavior, these cells appear to be the zebrafish equivalent of cells variably characterized as Fluorescent Granular Perithelial cells (FGPs), perivascular macrophages, or 'Mato Cells' in mammals. Despite their macrophage-like morphology and perivascular location, zebrafish FGPs appear molecularly most similar to lymphatic endothelium, and our imaging studies suggest that these cells emerge by transdifferentiation from endothelium of the optic choroidal vascular plexus. Our findings provide the first report of a perivascular cell population in the brain derived from vascular endothelium.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24369"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24369"}],"date":{"day":"11","month":"04","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"24369","entryfile":"elife-24369-v1.xml","files":[]}
