{"title":"Analysis of the NK2 homeobox gene <italic>ceh-24</italic> reveals sublateral motor neuron control of left-right turning during sleep","author":[{"surname":"Schwarz","given-names":"Juliane"},{"surname":"Bringmann","given-names":"Henrik"}],"abstract":"Sleep is a behavior that is found in all animals that have a nervous system and that have been studied carefully. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> larvae, sleep is associated with a turning behavior, called flipping, in which animals rotate 180{degree sign} about their longitudinal axis. However, the molecular and neural substrates of this enigmatic behavior are not known. Here, we identified the conserved NK-2 homeobox gene <italic>ceh-24</italic> to be crucially required for flipping. <italic>ceh-24</italic> is required for the formation of processes and for cholinergic function of sublateral motor neurons, which separately innervate the four body muscle quadrants. Knockdown of cholinergic function in a subset of these sublateral neurons, the SIAs, abolishes flipping. The SIAs depolarize during flipping and their optogenetic activation induces flipping in a fraction of events. Thus, we identified the sublateral SIA neurons to control the three-dimensional movements of flipping. These neurons may also control other types of motion.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24846"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24846"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24846","entryfile":"elife-24846-v2.xml","files":["elife-24846-v1.xml"]}
