At the cellular level, heart muscle cells generate higher force when stretched, but despite intense efforts the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. We applied a fluorescence-based method, which reports structural changes separately in the thick and thin filaments of rat cardiac muscle, to elucidate that mechanism. The distinct structural changes of troponin C in the thin filaments and myosin regulatory light chain in the thick filaments allowed us to identify two aspects of the Frank-Starling relation. Our results show that the enhanced force observed when heart muscle cells are maximally activated by calcium is due to a change in <italic>thick</italic> filament structure, but the increase in calcium sensitivity at lower calcium levels is due to a change in <italic>thin</italic> filament structure.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24081"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24081"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24081","entryfile":"elife-24081-v2.xml","files":["elife-24081-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24081-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24081-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24081-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24081-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24081-v1.xml"]}
