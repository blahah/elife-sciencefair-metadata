{"title":"Inhibitor of ppGalNAc-T3-mediated O-glycosylation blocks cancer cell invasiveness and lowers FGF23 levels","author":[{"surname":"Song","given-names":"Lina"},{"surname":"Linstedt","given-names":"Adam"}],"abstract":"Small molecule inhibitors of site-specific O-glycosylation by the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGalNAc-T) family are currently unavailable but hold promise as therapeutics, especially if selective against individual ppGalNAc-T isozymes. To identify a compound targeting the ppGalNAc-T3 isozyme, we screened libraries to find compounds that act on a cell-based fluorescence sensor of ppGalNAc-T3 but not on a sensor of ppGalNAc-T2. This identified a hit that subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis showed directly binds and inhibits purified ppGalNAc-T3 with no detectable activity against either ppGalNAc-T2 or ppGalNAc-T6. Remarkably, the inhibitor was active in two medically relevant contexts. In cell culture, it opposed increased cancer cell invasiveness driven by upregulated ppGalNAc-T3 suggesting the inhibitor might be anti-metastatic. In cells and mice, it blocked ppGalNAc-T3-mediated glycan-masking of FGF23 thereby increasing its cleavage, a possible treatment of chronic kidney disease. These findings establish a pharmacological approach for the ppGalNAc-transferase family and suggest that targeting specific ppGalNAc-transferases will yield new therapeutics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24051"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24051"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24051","entryfile":"elife-24051-v1.xml","files":[]}
