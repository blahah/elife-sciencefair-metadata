The consequent Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> 'misediting paradox' is resolved by EF-Tu in the cell. Here, we show that DTD’s active site architecture can efficiently edit mischarged Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species four orders of magnitude more efficiently than even AlaRS, the only ubiquitous cellular checkpoint known for clearing the error. Also, DTD knockout in AlaRS editing-defective background causes pronounced toxicity in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> even at low glycine levels which is alleviated by alanine supplementation. We further demonstrate that DTD positively selects the universally invariant tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>-specific G3•U70. Moreover, DTD’s activity on non-cognate Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> is conserved across all bacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting DTD’s key cellular role as a glycine deacylator. Our study thus reveals a hitherto unknown function of DTD in cracking the universal mechanistic dilemma encountered by AlaRS, and its physiological importance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24001"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24001"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24001","entryfile":"elife-24001-v1.xml","files":[]}
