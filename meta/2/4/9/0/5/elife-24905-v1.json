In Gram-negative bacteria, some of these pumps form multi-protein assemblies that span the cell envelope. Here we report the near-atomic resolution cryoEM structures of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump in resting and drug transport states, revealing a quaternary structural switch that allosterically couples and synchronizes initial ligand binding with channel opening. Within the transport-activated state, the channel remains open even though the pump cycles through three distinct conformations. Collectively, our data provide a dynamic mechanism for the assembly and operation of the AcrAB-TolC pump.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24905"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24905"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24905","entryfile":"elife-24905-v1.xml","files":[]}
