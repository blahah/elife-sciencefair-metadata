Despite their complexity, listeners readily detect changes in these contexts. We here address the neural basis of statistical decision-making using a combination of psychophysics, EEG and modelling. In a texture-based, change-detection paradigm, human performance and reaction times improved with longer pre-change exposure, consistent with improved estimation of baseline statistics. Change-locked and decision-related EEG responses were found in a centro-parietal scalp location, whose slope depended on change size, consistent with sensory evidence accumulation. The potential's amplitude scaled with the duration of pre-change exposure, suggesting a time-dependent decision threshold. Auditory cortex-related potentials showed no response to the change. A dual timescale, statistical estimation model accounted for subjects' performance. Furthermore, a decision-augmented auditory cortex model accounted for performance and reaction times, suggesting that the primary cortical representation requires little post-processing to enable change-detection in complex acoustic environments.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24910"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24910"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24910","entryfile":"elife-24910-v4.xml","files":["elife-24910-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig5-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-resp-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-resp-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-resp-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24910-resp-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-24910-v1.xml","elife-24910-v2.xml","elife-24910-v3.xml"]}
