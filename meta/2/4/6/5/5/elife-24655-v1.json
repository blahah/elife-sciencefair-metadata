Here we show that these agents activate the DNA damage response (DDR) kinases ATM and DNA-PKcs through the generation of double stranded breaks (DSBs) in murine macrophage genomic DNA. In contrast to other cell types, initiation of this DDR depends on signaling from the type I interferon receptor. Once activated, ATM and DNA-PKcs regulate a genetic program with diverse immune functions and promote inflammasome activation and the production of IL-1β and IL-18. Indeed, following infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, DNA-PKcs-deficient murine macrophages produce reduced levels of IL-18 and are unable to optimally stimulate IFN-γ production by NK cells. Thus, genomic DNA DSBs act as signaling intermediates in murine macrophages, regulating innate immune responses through the initiation of a type I IFN-dependent DDR.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24655"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24655"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24655","entryfile":"elife-24655-v1.xml","files":[]}
