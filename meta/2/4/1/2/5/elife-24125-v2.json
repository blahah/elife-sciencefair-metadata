Here, we examined how solutes and macromolecules are separated when they exit the phloem during the unloading process. We used a combination of approaches (non-invasive imaging, 3D-electron microscopy, and mathematical modelling) to show that phloem unloading of solutes in Arabidopsis roots occurs through plasmodesmata by a combination of mass flow and diffusion (convective phloem unloading). During unloading, solutes and proteins are diverted into the phloem-pole pericycle, a tissue connected to the protophloem by a unique class of ‘funnel plasmodesmata’. While solutes are unloaded without restriction, large proteins are released through funnel plasmodesmata in discrete pulses, a phenomenon we refer to as ‘batch unloading’. Unlike solutes, these proteins remain restricted to the phloem-pole pericycle. Our data demonstrate a major role for the phloem-pole pericycle in regulating phloem unloading in roots.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24125"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24125"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24125","entryfile":"elife-24125-v2.xml","files":["elife-24125-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24125-v1.xml"]}
