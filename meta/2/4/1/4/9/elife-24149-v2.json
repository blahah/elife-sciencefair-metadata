In pancreatic β-cells, channels formed by SUR1 and Kir6.2 regulate insulin secretion and are the targets of antidiabetic sulfonylureas. Here, we used cryo-EM to elucidate structural basis of channel assembly and gating. The structure, determined in the presence of ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, at ~6 Å resolution reveals a closed Kir6.2 tetrameric core with four peripheral SUR1s each anchored to a Kir6.2 by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24149"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24149"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24149","entryfile":"elife-24149-v2.xml","files":["elife-24149-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24149-v1.xml"]}
