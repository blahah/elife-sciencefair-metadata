{"title":"An unexpected role for the yeast nucleotide exchange factor Sil1 as a reductant acting on the molecular chaperone BiP","author":[{"surname":"Siegenthaler","given-names":"Kevin D"},{"surname":"Pareja","given-names":"Kristeen A"},{"surname":"Wang","given-names":"Jie"},{"surname":"Sevier","given-names":"Carolyn S"}],"abstract":"Unfavorable redox conditions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can decrease the capacity for protein secretion, altering vital cell functions. While systems to manage reductive stress are well-established, how cells cope with an overly oxidizing ER remains largely undefined. In previous work (Wang et al., 2014), we demonstrated that the chaperone BiP is a sensor of overly oxidizing ER conditions. We showed that modification of a conserved BiP cysteine during stress beneficially alters BiP chaperone activity to cope with suboptimal folding conditions. How this cysteine is reduced to reestablish 'normal' BiP activity post-oxidative stress has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that BiP's nucleotide exchange factor – Sil1 – can reverse BiP cysteine oxidation. This previously unexpected reductant capacity for yeast Sil1 has potential implications for the human ataxia Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, where it is interesting to speculate that a disruption in ER redox-signaling (due to genetic defects in <italic>SIL1</italic>) may influence disease pathology.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24141"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24141"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24141","entryfile":"elife-24141-v3.xml","files":["elife-24141-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24141-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-24141-v1.xml","elife-24141-v2.xml"]}
