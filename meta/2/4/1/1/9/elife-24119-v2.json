Its polymerization kinetics are unusual, permitting only short, unstable F-actin filaments. It has not been possible to study actin in vivo and so its physiological roles have remained obscure, leading to models distinct from conventional actin behaviour. Here a modified version of the commercially available actin-chromobody was tested as a novel tool for visualising F-actin dynamics in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii.</italic> Cb labels filamentous actin structures within the parasite cytosol and labels an extensive F-actin network that connects parasites within the parasitophorous vacuole and allows vesicles to be exchanged between parasites. In the absence of actin, parasites lack a residual body and inter-parasite connections and grow in an asynchronous and disorganized manner. Collectively, these data identify new roles for actin in the intracellular phase of the parasites lytic cycle and provide a robust new tool for imaging parasitic F-actin dynamics.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24119"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24119"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24119","entryfile":"elife-24119-v2.xml","files":["elife-24119-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-24119-v1.xml"]}
