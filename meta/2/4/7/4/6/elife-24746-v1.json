Here, we show that the mammalian kinesin-4 KIF21B is a processive motor that can accumulate at microtubule plus ends and induce pausing. A few KIF21B molecules are sufficient to induce strong growth inhibition of a microtubule plus end <italic>in vitro</italic>. This property depends on non-motor microtubule-binding domains located in the stalk region and the C-terminal WD40 domain. The WD40-containing KIF21B tail displays preference for a GTP- over a GDP-type microtubule lattice and contributes to the interaction of KIF21B with microtubule plus ends. KIF21B also contains a motor-inhibiting domain that does not fully block the interaction of the protein with microtubules, but rather enhances its pause-inducing activity by preventing KIF21B detachment from microtubule tips. Thus, KIF21B combines microtubule-binding and regulatory activities that together constitute an autonomous microtubule pausing factor.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"24746"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.24746"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"24746","entryfile":"elife-24746-v1.xml","files":[]}
