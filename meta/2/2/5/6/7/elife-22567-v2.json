It is unclear how the functions of the multiple domains of Munc13–1 are coordinated. The crystal structure of a Munc13–1 fragment including its C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN) reveals a 19.5 nm-long multi-helical structure with the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains packed at one end. The similar orientations of the respective diacyglycerol- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains suggest that the two domains cooperate in plasma-membrane binding and that activation of Munc13–1 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diacylglycerol during short-term presynaptic plasticity are closely interrelated. Electrophysiological experiments in mouse neurons support the functional importance of the domain interfaces observed in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN. The structure imposes key constraints for models of neurotransmitter release and suggests that Munc13–1 bridges the vesicle and plasma membranes from the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22567"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22567"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22567","entryfile":"elife-22567-v2.xml","files":["elife-22567-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig12-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig13-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-resp-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22567-v1.xml"]}
