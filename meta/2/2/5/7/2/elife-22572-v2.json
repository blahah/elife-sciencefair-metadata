{"title":"Interface between 40S exit channel protein uS7/Rps5 and eIF2α modulates start codon recognition in vivo","author":[{"surname":"Visweswaraiah","given-names":"Jyothsna"},{"surname":"Hinnebusch","given-names":"Alan G"}],"abstract":"The eukaryotic pre-initiation complex (PIC) bearing the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> ternary complex (TC) scans the mRNA for an AUG codon in favorable context. AUG recognition evokes rearrangement of the PIC from an open, scanning to a closed, arrested conformation. Cryo-EM reconstructions of yeast PICs suggest remodeling of the interface between 40S protein Rps5/uS7 and eIF2α between open and closed states; however, its importance was unknown. uS7 substitutions disrupting eIF2α contacts favored in the open complex increase initiation at suboptimal sites, and uS7-S223D stabilizes TC binding to PICs reconstituted with a UUG start codon, indicating inappropriate rearrangement to the closed state. Conversely, uS7-D215 substitutions, perturbing uS7-eIF2α interaction in the closed state, confer the opposite phenotypes of hyperaccuracy and (for D215L) accelerated TC dissociation from reconstituted PICs. Thus, remodeling of the uS7/eIF2α interface appears to stabilize first the open, and then the closed state of the PIC to promote accurate AUG selection in vivo.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22572"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22572"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"22572","entryfile":"elife-22572-v2.xml","files":["elife-22572-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22572-v1.xml"]}
