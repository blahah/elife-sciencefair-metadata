Maternally inherited factors play a key role in this critical developmental process, which occurs at the 2-cell stage in mice. We investigated the function of the maternally inherited factor STELLA (DPPA3) using single-cell/embryo approaches. We show that loss of maternal STELLA results in widespread transcriptional mis-regulation and a partial failure of MZT. Strikingly, activation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is significantly impaired in <italic>Stella</italic>maternal/zygotic knockout embryos, which in turn leads to a failure to upregulate chimeric transcripts. Amongst ERVs, MuERV-L activation is particularly affected by the absence of STELLA, and direct <italic>in vivo </italic>knockdown of MuERV-L impacts the developmental potential of the embryo. We propose that STELLA is involved in ensuring activation of ERVs, which themselves play a potentially key role during early development, either directly or through influencing embryonic gene expression.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22345"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22345"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22345","entryfile":"elife-22345-v1.xml","files":[]}
