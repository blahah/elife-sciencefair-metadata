{"title":"Activity-dependent regulation of T-type calcium channels by submembrane calcium ions","author":[{"surname":"Cazade","given-names":"Magali"},{"surname":"Bidaud","given-names":"Isabelle"},{"surname":"Lory","given-names":"Philippe"},{"surname":"Chemin","given-names":"Jean"}],"abstract":"Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are involved in numerous physiological functions and various mechanisms finely tune their activity, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion itself. This is well exemplified by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, whose alteration contributes to the dramatic disease Timothy Syndrome. For T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, a long-held view is that they are not regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Here we challenge this notion by using dedicated electrophysiological protocols on both native and expressed T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We demonstrate that a rise in submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a large decrease in T-type current amplitude due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation. Activation of most representative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ionotropic receptors similarly regulate T-type current properties. Altogether, our data clearly establish that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry exerts a feedback control on T-type channel activity, by modulating the channel availability, a mechanism that critically links cellular properties of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to their physiological roles.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22331"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22331"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22331","entryfile":"elife-22331-v2.xml","files":["elife-22331-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22331-v1.xml"]}
