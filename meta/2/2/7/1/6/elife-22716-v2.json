We have previously reported that myeloid-defective zebrafish mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin fold regeneration. Here, we found that the apoptosis phenotype is induced by prolonged expression of <italic>interleukin 1 beta</italic> (<italic>il1b</italic>). Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal source of Il1b, but we show that epithelial cells express <italic>il1b</italic> in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response, and that its resolution by macrophages is necessary for survival of regenerative cells. We further show that Il1b plays an essential role in normal fin fold regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study reveals that proper levels of Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22716"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22716"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22716","entryfile":"elife-22716-v2.xml","files":["elife-22716-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22716-v1.xml"]}
