However, the catalytic mechanism underlying this activity remains elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of <italic>Danio rerio</italic> POMK in complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, ADP, aluminum fluoride, and the GalNAc-β3-GlcNAc-β4-Man trisaccharide substrate, thereby providing a snapshot of the catalytic transition state of this unusual kinase. The active site of POMK is established by residues located in non-canonical positions and is stabilized by a disulfide bridge. GalNAc-β3-GlcNAc-β4-Man is recognized by a surface groove, and the GalNAc-β3-GlcNAc moiety mediates the majority of interactions with POMK. Expression of various POMK mutants in <italic>POMK</italic> knockout cells further validated the functional requirements of critical residues. Our results provide important insights into the ability of POMK to function specifically as a glycan kinase, and highlight the structural diversity of the human kinome.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22238"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22238"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22238","entryfile":"elife-22238-v2.xml","files":["elife-22238-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22238-v1.xml"]}
