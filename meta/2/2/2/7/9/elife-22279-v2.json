However, current cell type-specific gene disruption techniques in flies often reduce gene activity incompletely or rely on cell division. Here we describe FlpStop, a generalizable tool for conditional gene disruption and rescue in post-mitotic cells. In proof-of-principle experiments, we manipulated <italic>apterous</italic>, a regulator of wing development. Next, we produced conditional null alleles of <italic>Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1</italic> (<italic>Gad1</italic>) and <italic>Resistant to dieldrin</italic> (<italic>Rdl</italic>), genes vital for GABAergic neurotransmission, as well as <italic>cacophony</italic> (<italic>cac</italic>) and <italic>paralytic</italic> (<italic>para</italic>), voltage-gated ion channels central to neuronal excitability. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we manipulated <italic>cac</italic> in a specific visual interneuron type and discovered differential regulation of calcium signals across subcellular compartments. Thus, FlpStop will facilitate investigations into the interactions between genes, circuits, and computation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22279"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22279"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22279","entryfile":"elife-22279-v2.xml","files":["elife-22279-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22279-v1.xml"]}
