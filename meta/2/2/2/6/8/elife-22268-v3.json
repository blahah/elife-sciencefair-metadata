Here, we provide the neurosensory lineage reconstruction of a complex sensory organ, the inner ear, by imaging zebrafish embryos in vivo over an extended timespan, combining cell tracing and cell fate marker expression over time. We deliver the first dynamic map of early neuronal and sensory progenitor pools in the whole otic vesicle. It highlights the remodeling of the neuronal progenitor domain upon neuroblast delamination, and reveals that the order and place of neuroblasts’ delamination from the otic epithelium prefigure their position within the SAG. Sensory and non-sensory domains harbor different proliferative activity contributing distinctly to the overall growth of the structure. Therefore, the otic vesicle case exemplifies a generic morphogenetic process where spatial and temporal cues regulate cell fate and functional organization of the rudiment of the definitive organ.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22268"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22268"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22268","entryfile":"elife-22268-v3.xml","files":["elife-22268-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22268-v1.xml","elife-22268-v2.xml"]}
