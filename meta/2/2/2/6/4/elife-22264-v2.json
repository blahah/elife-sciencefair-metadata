An additional linkage for α5 and αIIb is the synergy site located in close proximity to the RGD motif. We report that mice with a dysfunctional FN-synergy motif (<italic>Fn1</italic>) suffer from surprisingly mild platelet adhesion and bleeding defects due to delayed thrombus formation after vessel injury. Additional loss of β3 integrins dramatically aggravates the bleedings and severely compromises smooth muscle cell coverage of the vasculature leading to embryonic lethality. Cell-based studies revealed that the synergy site is dispensable for the initial contact of α5β1 with the RGD, but essential to re-enforce the binding of α5β1/αIIbβ3 to FN. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for the FN synergy site when external forces exceed a certain threshold or when αvβ3 integrin levels decrease below a critical level.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22264"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22264"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22264","entryfile":"elife-22264-v2.xml","files":["elife-22264-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22264-v1.xml"]}
