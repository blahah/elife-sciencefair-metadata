However, the relationship between the perceived value of a reward, the latent value of a reward, and the behavioral response remains unclear. Here we report that, given a choice between two sweet and chemically similar sugars—L- and D-arabinose—<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> prefers D- over L- arabinose, but forms long-term memories of L-arabinose more reliably. Behavioral assays indicate that L-arabinose-generated memories require sugar receptor Gr43a, and calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings indicate that L- and D-arabinose differentially activate Gr43a-expressing neurons. We posit that the immediate valence of a reward is not always predictive of the long-term reinforcement value of that reward, and that a subset of sugar-sensing neurons may generate distinct representations of similar sugars, allowing for rapid assessment of the salient features of various sugar rewards and generation of reward-specific behaviors. However, how sensory neurons communicate information about L-arabinose quality and concentration—features relevant for long-term memory—remains unknown.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22283"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22283"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22283","entryfile":"elife-22283-v2.xml","files":["elife-22283-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22283-v1.xml"]}
