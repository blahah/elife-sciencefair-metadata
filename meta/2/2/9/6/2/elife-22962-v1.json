{"title":"Computational models of O-LM cells are recruited by low or high theta frequency inputs depending on h-channel distributions","author":[{"surname":"SekuliÄ‡","given-names":"Vladislav"},{"surname":"Skinner","given-names":"Frances K"}],"abstract":"Although biophysical details of inhibitory neurons are becoming known, it is challenging to map these details onto function. Oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-LM) cells are inhibitory cells in the hippocampus that gate information flow, firing while phase-locked to theta rhythms. We build on our existing computational model database of O-LM cells to link model with function. We place our models in high-conductance states and modulate inhibitory inputs at a wide range of frequencies. We find preferred spiking recruitment of models at high (4-9 Hz) or low (2-5 Hz) theta depending on, respectively, the presence or absence of h-channels on their dendrites. This also depends on slow delayed-rectifier potassium channels, and preferred theta ranges shift when h-channels are potentiated by cyclic AMP. Our results suggest that O-LM cells can be differentially recruited by frequency-modulated inputs depending on specific channel types and distributions. This work exposes a strategy for understanding how biophysical characteristics contribute to function.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22962"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22962"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22962","entryfile":"elife-22962-v1.xml","files":[]}
