However, the window of responsiveness to Hippo signaling, the exact timing of lineage commitment and the overall relationship between cell commitment and global gene expression changes are still unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing during lineage segregation revealed that the TE transcriptional profile stabilizes earlier than the ICM and prior to blastocyst formation. Using quantitative Cdx2-eGFP expression as a readout of Hippo signaling activity, we assessed the experimental potential of individual blastomeres based on their level of Cdx2-eGFP expression and correlated potential with gene expression dynamics. We find that TE specification and commitment coincide and occur at the time of transcriptional stabilization, whereas ICM cells still retain the ability to regenerate TE up to the early blastocyst stage. Plasticity of both lineages is coincident with their window of sensitivity to Hippo signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22906"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22906"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22906","entryfile":"elife-22906-v2.xml","files":["elife-22906-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22906-v1.xml"]}
