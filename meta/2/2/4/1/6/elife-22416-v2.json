Here, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 (OTUD2) as a novel interactor of TRAF6 in human cells. YOD1 binds to the C-terminal TRAF homology domain of TRAF6 that also serves as the interaction surface for the adaptor p62/Sequestosome-1, which is required for IL-1 signaling to NF-κB. We show that YOD1 competes with p62 for TRAF6 association and abolishes the sequestration of TRAF6 to cytosolic p62 aggregates by a non-catalytic mechanism. YOD1 associates with TRAF6 in unstimulated cells but is released upon IL-1β stimulation, thereby facilitating TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination as well as NEMO/IKKγ substrate ubiquitination. Further, IL-1 triggered IKK/NF-κB signaling and induction of target genes is decreased by YOD1 overexpression and augmented after YOD1 depletion. Hence, our data define that YOD1 antagonizes TRAF6/p62-dependent IL-1 signaling to NF-κB.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22416"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22416"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22416","entryfile":"elife-22416-v2.xml","files":["elife-22416-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22416-v1.xml"]}
