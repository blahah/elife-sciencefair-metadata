Here we identify miRNAs that are up-regulated in the rodent hippocampus upon contextual fear-conditioning and identify the vesicular transport and synaptogenesis pathways as the major targets of the fear-induced miRNAs. We demonstrate that miR-153, a member of this group, inhibits the expression of key components of the vesicular transport machinery, and down-regulates Glutamate receptor A1 trafficking and neurotransmitter release. MiR-153 expression is specifically induced during LTP induction in hippocampal slices and its knockdown in the hippocampus of adult mice results in enhanced fear memory. Our results suggest that miR-153, and possibly other fear-induced miRNAs, act as components of a negative feedback loop that blocks neuronal hyperactivity at least partly through the inhibition of the vesicular transport pathway.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22467"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22467"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22467","entryfile":"elife-22467-v3.xml","files":["elife-22467-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig9-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig9-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig9-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-fig9-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22467-v1.xml","elife-22467-v2.xml"]}
