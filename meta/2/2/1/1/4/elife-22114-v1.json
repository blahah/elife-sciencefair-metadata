The mechanisms promoting or delaying flowering in response to ambient temperature changes are only beginning to be understood. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS M</italic> (<italic>FLM</italic>) regulates flowering in the ambient temperature range and <italic>FLM</italic> is transcribed and alternatively spliced in a temperature-dependent manner. We identify polymorphic promoter and intronic sequences required for <italic>FLM</italic> expression and splicing. In transgenic experiments covering 69% of the available sequence variation in two distinct sites, we show that variation in the abundance of the <italic>FLM-ÃŸ</italic> splice form strictly correlate (R2 = 0.94) with flowering time over an extended vegetative period. The <italic>FLM</italic> polymorphisms lead to changes in <italic>FLM</italic> expression (PRO2+) but may also affect <italic>FLM</italic> intron 1 splicing (INT6+). This information could serve to buffer the anticipated negative effects on agricultural systems and flowering that may occur during climate change.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22114"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22114"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22114","entryfile":"elife-22114-v1.xml","files":[]}
