Their biological fidelity is therefore crucial for the interpretation of simulations. However, the number of published models, and the lack of standardization, make the comparison of ion channel models with one another and with experimental data difficult. Here, we present a framework for the automated large-scale classification of ion channel models. Using annotated metadata and responses to a set of voltage-clamp protocols, we assigned 2378 models of voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels coded in <italic>NEURON</italic> to 211 clusters. The <italic>IonChannelGenealogy</italic> (ICGenealogy) web interface provides an interactive resource for the categorization of new and existing models and experimental recordings. It enables quantitative comparisons of simulated and/or measured ion channel kinetics, and facilitates field-wide standardization of experimentally-constrained modeling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22152"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22152"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22152","entryfile":"elife-22152-v1.xml","files":["elife-22152-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22152-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
