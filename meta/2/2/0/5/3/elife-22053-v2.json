Knowledge about transmission remains incomplete, especially concerning potential transmission in geographic areas in which it has not yet been introduced. To identify unknown vectors of Zika, we developed a data-driven model linking vector species and the Zika virus via vector-virus trait combinations that confer a propensity toward associations in an ecological network connecting flaviviruses and their mosquito vectors. Our model predicts that thirty-five species may be able to transmit the virus, seven of which are found in the continental United States, including <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>. We suggest that empirical studies prioritize these species to confirm predictions of vector competence, enabling the correct identification of populations at risk for transmission within the United States.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22053"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22053"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22053","entryfile":"elife-22053-v2.xml","files":["elife-22053-app1-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22053-app1-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22053-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22053-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22053-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22053-v1.xml"]}
