We developed a lineage-selective method to map transcriptional enhancers, regulatory genomic regions that activate transcription, in mice. Since most tissue-specific enhancers are bound by the transcriptional co-activator Ep300, we used Cre-directed, lineage-specific Ep300 biotinylation and pulldown on immobilized streptavidin followed by next generation sequencing of co-precipitated DNA to identify lineage-specific enhancers. By driving this system with lineage-specific Cre transgenes, we mapped enhancers active in embryonic endothelial cells/blood or skeletal muscle. Analysis of these enhancers identified new transcription factor heterodimer motifs that likely regulate transcription in these lineages. Furthermore, we identified candidate enhancers that regulate adult heart- or lung- specific endothelial cell specialization. Our strategy for tissue-specific protein biotinylation opens new avenues for studying lineage-specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22039"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22039"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22039","entryfile":"elife-22039-v2.xml","files":["elife-22039-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig7-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22039-v1.xml"]}
