Accumulation of misfolded proteins triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress that leads to unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is relayed to the cell through the activation of PERK, IRE1/XBP1, and ATF6. Here, we demonstrate that levels of PERK and IRE1 are increased in satellite cells upon muscle injury. Inhibition of PERK, but not the IRE1 arm of the UPR in satellite cells inhibits myofiber regeneration in adult mice. PERK is essential for the survival and differentiation of activated satellite cells into the myogenic lineage. Deletion of PERK causes hyper-activation of p38 MAPK during myogenesis. Blocking p38 MAPK activity improves the survival and differentiation of PERK-deficient satellite cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and muscle formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, our results suggest that the PERK arm of the UPR plays a pivotal role in the regulation of satellite cell homeostasis during regenerative myogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22871"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22871"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22871","entryfile":"elife-22871-v1.xml","files":[]}
