It is unknown whether such sensitivity to spatial patterns can be accomplished in simpler nervous <italic>systems</italic> that lack long-range sensory modalities such as vision and hearing. Here we show that the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> can discriminate spatial patterns in its surroundings, despite having a nervous system of only 302 neurons. This spatial pattern selectivity requires touch-dependent dopamine signaling, including the mechanosensory TRP-4 channel in dopaminergic neurons and the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3. We find that spatial pattern selectivity varies significantly among <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild isolates. Electrophysiological recordings show that natural variations in TRP-4 reduce the mechanosensitivity of dopaminergic neurons. Polymorphic substitutions in either TRP-4 or DOP-3 alter the selectivity of spatial patterns. Together, these results demonstrate an ancestral role for dopamine signaling in tuning spatial pattern preferences in a simple nervous system.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22896"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22896"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22896","entryfile":"elife-22896-v2.xml","files":["elife-22896-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-22896-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-22896-v1.xml"]}
