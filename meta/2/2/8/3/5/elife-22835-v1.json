Here, we describe a novel mechanism of metabolic co-regulation in which an intermediate in one pathway is converted into signals that activate a second pathway. Our study focused on the co-regulation of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and pyoluteorin, two antimicrobial metabolites produced by the soil bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic>. We show that an intermediate in DAPG biosynthesis, phloroglucinol, is transformed by a halogenase encoded in the pyoluteorin gene cluster into mono- and di-chlorinated phloroglucinols. The chlorinated phloroglucinols function as intra- and inter-cellular signals that induce the expression of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes, pyoluteorin production, and pyoluteorin-mediated inhibition of the plant-pathogenic bacterium <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>. This metabolic co-regulation provides a strategy for <italic>P. protegens</italic> to optimize the deployment of secondary metabolites with distinct roles in cooperative and competitive microbial interactions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22835"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22835"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22835","entryfile":"elife-22835-v1.xml","files":[]}
