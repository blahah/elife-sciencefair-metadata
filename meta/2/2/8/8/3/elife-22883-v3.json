The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg<sup>2+</sup>. SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3’UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>, leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"22883"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.22883"}],"date":{"day":"13","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"22883","entryfile":"elife-22883-v3.xml","files":["elife-22883-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-22883-v1.xml","elife-22883-v2.xml"]}
