Mutation of <italic>ADAR1</italic> leads to a severe neurodevelopmental and inflammatory disease of children, Aicardi-Gouti√©res syndrome. In mice, <italic>Adar1</italic> mutations are embryonic lethal but are rescued by mutation of the <italic>Mda5</italic> or <italic>Mavs</italic> genes, which function in IFN induction. However, the specific IFN regulated proteins responsible for the pathogenic effects of <italic>ADAR1</italic> mutation are unknown. We show that the cell-lethal phenotype of <italic>ADAR1</italic> deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells is rescued by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the <italic>RNASEL</italic> gene or by expression of the RNase L antagonist, murine coronavirus NS2 accessory protein. Our result demonstrate that ablation of RNase L activity promotes survival of ADAR1 deficient cells even in the presence of MDA5 and MAVS, suggesting that the RNase L system is the primary sensor pathway for endogenous dsRNA that leads to cell death.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"25687"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.25687"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"25687","entryfile":"elife-25687-v1.xml","files":[]}
