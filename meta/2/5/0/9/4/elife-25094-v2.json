{"title":"Dual role for Jumu in the control of hematopoietic progenitors in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland","author":[{"surname":"Hao","given-names":"Yangguang"},{"surname":"Jin","given-names":"Li Hua"}],"abstract":"The <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland is a hematopoietic organ in which the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cell fate relies on intrinsic factors and extensive interaction with cells within a microenvironment. The posterior signaling center (PSC) is required for maintaining the balance between progenitors and their differentiation into mature hemocytes. Moreover, some factors from the progenitors cell-autonomously control blood cell differentiation. Here, we show that Jumeau (Jumu), a member of the forkhead (Fkh) transcription factor family, controls hemocyte differentiation of lymph gland through multiple regulatory mechanisms. Jumu maintains the proper differentiation of prohemocytes by cell-autonomously regulating the expression of Col in medullary zone and by non-cell-autonomously preventing the generation of expanded PSC cells. Jumu can also cell-autonomously control the proliferation of PSC cells through positive regulation of dMyc expression. We also show that a deficiency of <italic>jumu</italic> throughout the lymph gland can induce the differentiation of lamellocytes via activating Toll signaling.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"25094"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.25094"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"25094","entryfile":"elife-25094-v2.xml","files":["elife-25094-v1.xml"]}
