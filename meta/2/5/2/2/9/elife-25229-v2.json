Pteridines, such as pterins, folates, and flavins, are heterocyclic metabolites that often serve as redox-active cofactors. The biosynthetic machineries for the construction of these distinct classes of small molecules operate independently in the cell. Here, we discovered an unprecedented nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster in <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> using genome synteny analysis. <italic>P. luminescens</italic> is a Gammaproteobacterium that undergoes phenotypic variation and can serve both pathogenic and mutualistic roles. Through extensive gene deletion, pathway-targeted molecular networking, quantitative proteomic analysis, and NMR, we show that the genetic locus affects the regulation of quorum sensing and secondary metabolic enzymes and encodes new pteridine metabolites functionalized with <italic>cis</italic>-amide acyl-side chains, termed pepteridine A <bold>1</bold> and B <bold>2</bold>. The pepteridines are produced in the pathogenic phenotypic variant and represent the first reported metabolites to be synthesized by a hybrid NRPS-pteridine pathway.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"25229"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.25229"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"25229","entryfile":"elife-25229-v2.xml","files":["elife-25229-v1.xml"]}
