Nun fits tightly into the TEC by taking advantage of gaps between the RNAP and the nucleic acids. The C-terminal segment of Nun interacts with the RNAP β and β’ subunits inside the RNAP active site cleft as well as with nearly every element of the nucleic-acid scaffold, essentially crosslinking the RNAP and the nucleic acids to prevent translocation, a mechanism supported by the effects of Nun amino acid substitutions. The nature of Nun interactions inside the RNAP active site cleft suggests that RNAP clamp opening is required for Nun to establish its interactions, explaining why Nun acts on paused TECs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"25478"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.25478"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"25478","entryfile":"elife-25478-v1.xml","files":[]}
