Here we report crystal structures of ectodomain fragments comprising cell-cell recognition regions of mouse γ-Pcdhs γA1, γA8, γB2, and γB7 revealing <italic>trans</italic>-homodimers, and of C-terminal ectodomain fragments from γ-Pcdhs γA4 and γB2, which depict <italic>cis</italic>-interacting regions in monomeric form. Together these structures span the entire γ-Pcdh ectodomain. The <italic>trans</italic>-dimer structures reveal determinants of γ-Pcdh isoform-specific homophilic recognition. We identified and structurally mapped <italic>cis</italic>-dimerization mutations to the C-terminal ectodomain structures. Biophysical studies showed that Pcdh ectodomains from γB-subfamily isoforms formed <italic>cis</italic> dimers, whereas γA isoforms did not, but both γA and γB isoforms could interact in <italic>cis</italic> with α-Pcdhs. Together, these data show how interaction specificity is distributed over all domains of the γ-Pcdh <italic>trans</italic> interface, and suggest that subfamily- or isoform-specific <italic>cis</italic>-interactions may play a role in the Pcdh-mediated neuronal self-recognition code.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20930"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20930"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20930","entryfile":"elife-20930-v2.xml","files":["elife-20930-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20930-v1.xml"]}
