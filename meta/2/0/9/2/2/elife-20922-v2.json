This cascade involves the ubiquitylation of histone H2A by the RNF168 ligase and the subsequent recruitment of RIF1, which suppresses homologous recombination (HR) in G1 cells. The RIF1-dependent suppression is relieved in S/G2 cells, allowing PALB2-driven HR to occur. With the inhibitory impact of RIF1 relieved, it remains unclear how RNF168-induced ubiquitylation influences HR. Here, we uncover that RNF168 links the HR machinery to H2A ubiquitylation in S/G2 cells. We show that PALB2 indirectly recognizes histone ubiquitylation by physically associating with ubiquitin-bound RNF168. This direct interaction is mediated by the newly identified PALB2-interacting domain (PID) in RNF168 and the WD40 domain in PALB2, and drives DNA repair by facilitating the assembly of PALB2-containing HR complexes at DSBs. Our findings demonstrate that RNF168 couples PALB2-dependent HR to H2A ubiquitylation to promote DNA repair and preserve genome integrity.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20922"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20922"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20922","entryfile":"elife-20922-v2.xml","files":["elife-20922-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20922-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20922-v1.xml"]}
