Here we report that CNS-specific <italic>Snx6</italic> knockout mice exhibit deficits in spatial learning and memory, accompanied with loss of spines from distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. SNX6 interacts with Homer1b/c, a postsynaptic scaffold protein crucial for the synaptic distribution of other postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins and structural integrity of dendritic spines. We show that SNX6 functions independently of retromer to regulate distribution of Homer1b/c in the dendritic shaft. We also find that Homer1b/c translocates from shaft to spines by protein diffusion, which does not require SNX6. Ablation of SNX6 causes reduced distribution of Homer1b/c in distal dendrites, decrease in surface levels of AMPAR and impaired AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. These findings reveal a physiological role of SNX6 in CNS excitatory neurons.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20991"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20991"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20991","entryfile":"elife-20991-v2.xml","files":["elife-20991-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig10-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig10-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig9-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig9-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig9-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20991-v1.xml"]}
