Using enhancer mapping and live imaging in avian embryos, and genetic lineage tracing in mice, we investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of cardiovascular progenitor populations. We show that expression of the cardiac transcription factor <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> marks a mesodermal population outside of the cardiac crescent in the extraembryonic and lateral plate mesoderm, with characteristics of hemogenic angioblasts. Extra-cardiac <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> lineage progenitors migrate into the embryo and contribute to clusters of CD41<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup> and RUNX1<sup>+</sup> cells in the endocardium, the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region of the dorsal aorta and liver. We also demonstrated that ectopic expression of <italic>Nkx2.5 </italic>in chick embryos activates the hemoangiogenic gene expression program. Taken together, we identified a hemogenic angioblast cell lineage characterized by transient <italic>Nkx2.5 </italic>expression that contributes to hemogenic endothelium and endocardium, suggesting a novel role for <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> in hemoangiogenic lineage specification and diversification.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20994"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20994"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20994","entryfile":"elife-20994-v1.xml","files":[]}
