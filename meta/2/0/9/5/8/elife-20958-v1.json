We now show: (1) that ANGPTL4 inactivates LPL by catalyzing the unfolding of its hydrolase domain; (2) that binding to GPIHBP1 renders LPL largely refractory to this inhibition; and (3) that both the LU domain and the intrinsically disordered acidic domain of GPIHBP1 are required for this protective effect. Genetic studies have found that a common polymorphic variant in ANGPTL4 results in lower plasma triglyceride levels. We now report: (1) that this ANGPTL4 variant is less efficient in catalyzing the unfolding of LPL; and (2) that its Glu-to-Lys substitution destabilizes its N-terminal α-helix. Our work elucidates the molecular basis for regulation of LPL activity by ANGPTL4, highlights the physiological relevance of the inherent instability of LPL, and sheds light on the molecular defects in a clinically relevant variant of ANGPTL4.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20958"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20958"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20958","entryfile":"elife-20958-v1.xml","files":["elife-20958-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20958-fig6-v1-600w.jpg"]}
