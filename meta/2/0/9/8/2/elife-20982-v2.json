Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20982"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20982"}],"date":{"day":"26","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20982","entryfile":"elife-20982-v2.xml","files":["elife-20982-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20982-v1.xml"]}
