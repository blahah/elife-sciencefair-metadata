While excavating a Byzantine cemetery in Troy, we discovered calcified abscesses among a woman’s remains. Scanning electron microscopy of the tissue revealed ‘ghost cells’, resulting from dystrophic calcification, which preserved ancient maternal, fetal and bacterial DNA of a severe infection, likely chorioamnionitis. <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</italic> dominated the abscesses. Phylogenomic analyses of ancient, historical, and contemporary data showed that <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> Troy fell within contemporary genetic diversity, whereas <italic>S. saprophyticus</italic> Troy belongs to a lineage that does not appear to be commonly associated with human disease today. We speculate that the ecology of <italic>S. saprophyticus</italic> infection may have differed in the ancient world as a result of close contacts between humans and domesticated animals. These results highlight the complex and dynamic interactions with our microbial milieu that underlie severe maternal infections.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20983"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20983"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"20983","entryfile":"elife-20983-v1.xml","files":["elife-20983-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-figsupp9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig4-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig4-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20983-fig4-v1-600w.jpg"]}
