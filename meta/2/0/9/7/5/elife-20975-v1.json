Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset ≤1 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20975"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20975"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20975","entryfile":"elife-20975-v1.xml","files":["elife-20975-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20975-fig7-v1-600w.jpg"]}
