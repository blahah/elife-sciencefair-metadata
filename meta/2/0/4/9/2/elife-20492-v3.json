We bridge this gap using data from a large and long-standing HIV-1 prospective cohort, in Uganda. We use an epidemiological-evolutionary model parameterised with this data to derive evolutionary predictions based on analysis and detailed individual-based simulations. We robustly predict stabilising selection towards a low level of virulence, and rapid attenuation of the virus. Accordingly, set-point viral load, the most common measure of virulence, has declined in the last 20 years. Our model also predicts that subtype A is slowly outcompeting subtype D, with both subtypes becoming less virulent, as observed in the data. Reduction of set-point viral loads should have resulted in a 20% reduction in incidence, and a three years extension of untreated asymptomatic infection, increasing opportunities for timely treatment of infected individuals.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20492"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20492"}],"date":{"day":"05","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20492","entryfile":"elife-20492-v3.xml","files":["elife-20492-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig2-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig2-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20492-v1.xml","elife-20492-v2.xml"]}
