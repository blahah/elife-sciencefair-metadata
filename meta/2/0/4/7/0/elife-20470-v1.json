In the superficial layers of the superior colliculus of the midbrain, converging projections from retinal ganglion cells and neurons in visual cortex must be aligned to form a visuotopic map, but the basic mechanisms mediating this alignment remain elusive. In a new mouse model, ectopic expression of ephrin-A3 (<italic>Efna3</italic>) in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, quantitatively altering the retinal EFNAs gradient, disrupts cortico-collicular map alignment onto the retino-collicular map, creating a visuotopic mismatch. Genetic inactivation of ectopic EFNA3 restores a wild-type cortico-collicular map. Theoretical analyses using a new mapping algorithm model both map formation and alignment, and recapitulate our experimental observations. The algorithm is based on an initial sensory map, the retino-collicular map, which carries intrinsic topographic information, the retinal EFNAs, to the superior colliculus. These EFNAs subsequently topographically align ingrowing visual cortical axons to the retino-collicular map.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20470"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20470"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20470","entryfile":"elife-20470-v1.xml","files":["elife-20470-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig4-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-fig9-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-resp-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-resp-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20470-resp-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
