We have identified mutations in genes encoding ribosomal components in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> that confer resistance to several structurally and mechanistically unrelated classes of antibiotics and enhance survival following heat shock and membrane stress. These mutations affect ribosome assembly and cause large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic changes, including the downregulation of the catalase KatG, an activating enzyme required for isoniazid sensitivity, and upregulation of WhiB7, a transcription factor involved in innate antibiotic resistance. Importantly, while these ribosomal mutations have a fitness cost in antibiotic-free medium, in a multidrug environment they promote the evolution of high-level, target-based resistance. Further, suppressor mutations can then be easily acquired to restore wild-type growth. Thus, ribosomal mutations can serve as stepping-stones in an evolutionary path leading to the emergence of high-level, multidrug resistance.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20420"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20420"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20420","entryfile":"elife-20420-v1.xml","files":["elife-20420-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20420-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
