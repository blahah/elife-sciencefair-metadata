Here we report that ankyrin-B (AnkB), through integrating all three systems, functions as a critical node in the protein circuitry underlying polarized recycling of α5β1-integrin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which enables persistent fibroblast migration along fibronectin gradients. AnkB associates with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-positive organelles in fibroblasts and binds dynactin to promote their long-range motility. We demonstrate that AnkB binds to Rab GTPase Activating Protein 1-Like (RabGAP1L) and recruits it to PI3P-positive organelles, where RabGAP1L inactivates Rab22A, and promotes polarized trafficking to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. We further determine that α5β1-integrin depends on an AnkB/RabGAP1L complex for polarized recycling. Our results reveal AnkB as an unexpected key element in coordinating polarized transport of α5β1-integrin and likely of other specialized endocytic cargos.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20417"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20417"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20417","entryfile":"elife-20417-v2.xml","files":["elife-20417-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig6-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20417-v1.xml"]}
