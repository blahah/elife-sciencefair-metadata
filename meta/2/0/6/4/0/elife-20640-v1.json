Here we dissect at the cytological, functional and structural level a conserved polarization module from the free living α-proteobacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and an orthologous system from an obligate intracellular (rickettsial) pathogen. The NMR solution structure of the zinc-finger (ZnR) domain from the bifunctional and bipolar ZitP pilus assembly/motility regulator revealed conserved interaction determinants for PopZ, a bipolar matrix protein that anchors the ParB centromere-binding protein and other regulatory factors at the poles. We show that ZitP regulates cytokinesis and the localization of ParB and PopZ, targeting PopZ independently of the previously known binding sites for its client proteins. Through heterologous localization assays with rickettsial ZitP and PopZ orthologs, we document the shared ancestries, activities and structural determinants of a (bi-)polarization system encoded in free-living and obligate intracellular α-proteobacteria.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20640"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20640"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20640","entryfile":"elife-20640-v1.xml","files":["elife-20640-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20640-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
