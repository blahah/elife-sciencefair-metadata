In mammals, most organ-specific N-glycosylation events occur in the brain. Yet, little is known about the nature, function and regulation of N-glycosylation in neurons. Using imaging, quantitative immunoblotting and mass spectrometry, we show that hundreds of neuronal surface membrane proteins are core-glycosylated, resulting in the neuronal membrane displaying surprisingly high levels of glycosylation profiles that are classically associated with immature intracellular proteins. We report that while N-glycosylation is generally required for dendritic development and glutamate receptor surface expression, core-glycosylated proteins are sufficient to sustain these processes, and are thus functional. This atypical glycosylation of surface neuronal proteins can be attributed to a bypass or a hypo-function of the Golgi apparatus. Core-glycosylation is regulated by synaptic activity, modulates synaptic signaling and accelerates the turnover of GluA2-containing glutamate receptors, revealing a novel mechanism that controls the composition and sensing properties of the neuronal membrane.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20609"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20609"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20609","entryfile":"elife-20609-v3.xml","files":["elife-20609-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig7-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20609-v1.xml","elife-20609-v2.xml"]}
