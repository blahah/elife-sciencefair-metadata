Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGFβ is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced naïve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20600"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20600"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20600","entryfile":"elife-20600-v1.xml","files":["elife-20600-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig10-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig11-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig11-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig11-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig11-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig11-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig11-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig12-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig12-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig12-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig13-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig13-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig13-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig13-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig5-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig5-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig5-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig6-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig6-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig8-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20600-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
