Nevertheless, the question how different antigen loads are translated into appropriate IL-2 production to ensure adequate responses against pathogens remains largely unexplored. Here we find that at single cell level, IL-2 is binary (digital) and CD25 is graded expressed whereas at population level both parameters show graded expression correlating with the antigen amount. Combining in vivo data with a mathematical model we demonstrate that only this binary IL-2 expression ensures a wide linear antigen response range for Teff and Treg cells under real spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore, at low antigen concentrations binary IL-2 expression safeguards by its spatial distribution selective STAT5 activation only of closely adjacent Treg cells regardless of their antigen specificity. These data show that the mode of IL-2 secretion is critical to tailor the adaptive immune response to the antigen amount.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20616"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20616"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20616","entryfile":"elife-20616-v1.xml","files":["elife-20616-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig1-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig1-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig1-figsupp6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20616-fig5-v1-600w.jpg"]}
