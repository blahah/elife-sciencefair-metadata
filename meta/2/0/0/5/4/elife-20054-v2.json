{"title":"SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels mediates the early response to acute hypoxia in central neurons","author":[{"surname":"Plant","given-names":"Leigh D"},{"surname":"Marks","given-names":"Jeremy D"},{"surname":"Goldstein","given-names":"Steve AN"}],"abstract":"The mechanism for the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia—an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (<italic>I</italic>)—has been unknown. Here, we show that hypoxia activates the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and that SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels increases <italic>I</italic>. The time-course for SUMOylation of single Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels at the cell surface and changes in <italic>I</italic> coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme. Within 40 s, hypoxia-induced linkage of SUMO1 to the channels is complete, shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. Given the recognized role of <italic>I</italic> in hypoxic brain damage, the SUMO pathway and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20054"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20054"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20054","entryfile":"elife-20054-v2.xml","files":["elife-20054-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20054-v1.xml"]}
