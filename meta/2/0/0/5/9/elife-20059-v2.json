MEF2C is highly expressed in developing cortical excitatory neurons, but its role in their development remains unclear. We show here that conditional embryonic deletion of <italic>Mef2c</italic> in cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons (Emx1-lineage) produces a dramatic reduction in cortical network activity in vivo, due in part to a dramatic increase in inhibitory and a decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission. In addition, we find that MEF2C regulates E/I synapse density predominantly as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor. Analysis of differential gene expression in <italic>Mef2c</italic> mutant cortex identified a significant overlap with numerous synapse- and autism-linked genes, and the <italic>Mef2c</italic> mutant mice displayed numerous behaviors reminiscent of autism, ID and SCZ, suggesting that perturbing MEF2C function in neocortex can produce autistic- and ID-like behaviors in mice.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20059"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20059"}],"date":{"day":"25","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20059","entryfile":"elife-20059-v2.xml","files":["elife-20059-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20059-v1.xml"]}
