Using murine myelin-reactive CD4 T cells, we demonstrate that proximal T cell signaling modulates Notch activation by a spatiotemporally constrained mechanism. The protein kinase PKCθ is a critical mediator of signaling by the T cell antigen receptor and the principal costimulatory receptor CD28. PKCθ selectively inactivates the negative regulator of F-actin generation, Coronin 1A, at the center of the T cell interface with the antigen presenting cell (APC). This allows for effective generation of the large actin-based lamellum required for recruitment of the Notch-processing membrane metalloproteinase ADAM10. Such enhancement of Notch activation is critical for efficient T cell proliferation and Th17 differentiation. We reveal a novel mechanism that, through modulation of the cytoskeleton, controls Notch activation at the T cell:APC interface thereby linking T cell receptor and Notch signaling pathways.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20003"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20003"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20003","entryfile":"elife-20003-v3.xml","files":["elife-20003-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20003-v1.xml","elife-20003-v2.xml"]}
