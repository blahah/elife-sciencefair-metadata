Using <italic>Aspergillus nidulans,</italic> we show that AP-2 has a clathrin-independent essential role in polarity maintenance and growth. This is in line with a sequence analysis showing that the AP-2 β subunit (β2) of higher fungi lacks a clathrin-binding domain, and experiments showing that AP-2 does not co-localize with clathrin. We provide genetic and cellular evidence that AP-2 interacts with endocytic markers SlaB<sup>End4</sup> and SagA<sup>End3</sup> and the lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB in the sub-apical collar region of hyphae. The role of AP-2 in the maintenance of proper apical membrane lipid and cell wall composition is further supported by its functional interaction with BasA (sphingolipid biosynthesis) and StoA (apical sterol-rich membrane domains), and its essentiality in polar deposition of chitin. Our findings support that the AP-2 complex of dikarya has acquired, in the course of evolution, a specialized clathrin-independent function necessary for fungal polar growth.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20083"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20083"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20083","entryfile":"elife-20083-v2.xml","files":["elife-20083-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20083-v1.xml"]}
