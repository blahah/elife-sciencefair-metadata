{"title":"The fail-safe mechanism of post-transcriptional silencing of unspliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA","author":[{"surname":"Di Santo","given-names":"Rachael"},{"surname":"Aboulhouda","given-names":"Soufiane"},{"surname":"Weinberg","given-names":"David E"}],"abstract":"<italic>HAC1</italic> encodes a transcription factor that is the central effector of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in budding yeast. When the UPR is inactive, <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA is stored as an unspliced isoform in the cytoplasm and no Hac1 protein is detectable. Intron removal is both necessary and sufficient to relieve the post-transcriptional silencing of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA, yet the precise mechanism by which the intron prevents Hac1 protein accumulation has remained elusive. Here, we show that a combination of inhibited translation initiation and accelerated protein degradation—both dependent on the intron—prevents the accumulation of Hac1 protein when the UPR is inactive. Functionally, both components of this fail-safe silencing mechanism are required to prevent ectopic production of Hac1 protein and concomitant activation of the UPR. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of <italic>HAC1</italic> regulation and reveal a novel strategy for complete post-transcriptional silencing of a cytoplasmic mRNA.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20069"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20069"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20069","entryfile":"elife-20069-v2.xml","files":["elife-20069-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20069-v1.xml"]}
