Their inhibition is predicted to have pleiotropic effects, but it is unclear whether this will impact on the clinical utility of CDK8/19 inhibitors. We discovered two series of potent chemical probes with high selectivity for CDK8/19. Despite pharmacodynamic evidence for robust on-target activity, the compounds exhibited modest, though significant, efficacy against human tumor lines and patient-derived xenografts. Altered gene expression was consistent with CDK8/19 inhibition, including profiles associated with super-enhancers, immune and inflammatory responses and stem cell function. In a mouse model expressing oncogenic beta-catenin, treatment shifted cells within hyperplastic intestinal crypts from a stem cell to a transit amplifying phenotype. In two species, neither probe was tolerated at therapeutically-relevant exposures. The complex nature of the toxicity observed with two structurally-differentiated chemical series is consistent with on-target effects posing significant challenges to the clinical development of CDK8/19 inhibitors.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20722"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20722"}],"date":{"day":"09","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20722","entryfile":"elife-20722-v3.xml","files":["elife-20722-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20722-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20722-v1.xml","elife-20722-v2.xml"]}
