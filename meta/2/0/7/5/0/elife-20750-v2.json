We found that the RNA- binding protein Sam68 (Khdrbs1) is strongly expressed in neurogenic areas of the neocortex and supports the self-renewing potential of mouse NPCs. Knockout of <italic>Khdrbs1</italic> constricted the pool of proliferating NPCs by accelerating their cell cycle exit and differentiation into post-mitotic neurons. Sam68 function was linked to regulation of <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. Binding of Sam68 to an intronic polyadenylation site prevents its recognition and premature transcript termination, favoring expression of a functional enzyme. The lower ALDH1A3 expression and activity in <italic>Khdrbs1</italic> NPCs results in reduced glycolysis and clonogenicity, thus depleting the embryonic NPC pool and limiting cortical expansion. Our study identifies Sam68 as a key regulator of NPC self-renewal and establishes a novel link between modulation of ALDH1A3 expression and maintenance of high glycolytic metabolism in the developing cortex.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20750"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20750"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20750","entryfile":"elife-20750-v2.xml","files":["elife-20750-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20750-v1.xml"]}
