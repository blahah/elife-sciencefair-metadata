Here, we discovered that, in the developing neuron from rat, Akt signaling regulates axon growth and growth cone formation through phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) on Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2). This enhances Id2 protein stability by means of escape from proteasomal degradation, and steers its localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin that is critical for growth cone formation. Knockdown of <italic>Id2,</italic> or abrogation of Id2 phosphorylation at S14, greatly impairs axon growth and the architecture of growth cone. Intriguingly, reinstatement of Akt/Id2 signaling after injury in mouse hippocampal slices redeemed growth promoting ability, leading to obvious axon regeneration. Our results suggest that Akt/Id2 signaling is a key module for growth cone formation and axon growth, and its augmentation plays a potential role in CNS axonal regeneration.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20799"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20799"}],"date":{"day":"12","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20799","entryfile":"elife-20799-v1.xml","files":["elife-20799-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig6-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20799-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
