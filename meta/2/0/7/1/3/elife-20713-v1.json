Identifying the circuitry underlying copulation is a necessary step towards understanding universal principles of circuit operation, and how circuit elements are recruited into the production of ordered action sequences. Here, we identify key sex-specific neurons that mediate copulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and define a sexually dimorphic motor circuit in the male abdominal ganglion that mediates the action sequence of initiating and terminating copulation. This sexually dimorphic circuit composed of three neuronal classes – motor neurons, interneurons and mechanosensory neurons – controls the mechanics of copulation. By correlating the connectivity, function and activity of these neurons we have determined the logic for how this circuitry is coordinated to generate this male-specific behavior, and sets the stage for a circuit-level dissection of active sensing and modulation of copulatory behavior.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20713"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20713"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"20713","entryfile":"elife-20713-v1.xml","files":["elife-20713-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20713-fig8-v1-600w.jpg"]}
