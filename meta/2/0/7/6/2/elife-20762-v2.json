{"title":"Frazzled promotes growth cone attachment at the source of a Netrin gradient in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system","author":[{"surname":"Akin","given-names":"Orkun"},{"surname":"Zipursky","given-names":"S Lawrence"}],"abstract":"Axon guidance is proposed to act through a combination of long- and short-range attractive and repulsive cues. The ligand-receptor pair, Netrin (Net) and Frazzled (Fra) (DCC, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer, in vertebrates), is recognized as the prototypical effector of chemoattraction, with roles in both long- and short-range guidance. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, R8 photoreceptor growth cones were shown to require Net-Fra to reach their target, the peak of a Net gradient. Using live imaging, we show, however, that R8 growth cones reach and recognize their target without Net, Fra, or Trim9, a conserved binding partner of Fra, but do not remain attached to it. Thus, despite the graded ligand distribution along the guidance path, Net-Fra is not used for chemoattraction. Based on findings in other systems, we propose that adhesion to substrate-bound Net underlies both long- and short-range Net-Fra-dependent guidance <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby eroding the distinction between them.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20762"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20762"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20762","entryfile":"elife-20762-v2.xml","files":["elife-20762-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20762-v1.xml"]}
