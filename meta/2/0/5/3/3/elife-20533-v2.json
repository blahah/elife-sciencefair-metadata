{"title":"RNase H enables efficient repair of R-loop induced DNA damage","author":[{"surname":"Amon","given-names":"Jeremy D"},{"surname":"Koshland","given-names":"Douglas"}],"abstract":"R-loops, three-stranded structures that form when transcripts hybridize to chromosomal DNA, are potent agents of genome instability. This instability has been explained by the ability of R-loops to induce DNA damage. Here, we show that persistent R-loops also compromise DNA repair. Depleting endogenous RNase H activity impairs R-loop removal in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, causing DNA damage that occurs preferentially in the repetitive ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA). We analyzed the repair kinetics of this damage and identified mutants that modulate repair. We present a model that the persistence of R-loops at sites of DNA damage induces repair by break-induced replication (BIR). This R-loop induced BIR is particularly susceptible to the formation of lethal repair intermediates at the rDNA because of a barrier imposed by RNA polymerase I.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20533"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20533"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20533","entryfile":"elife-20533-v2.xml","files":["elife-20533-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20533-v1.xml"]}
