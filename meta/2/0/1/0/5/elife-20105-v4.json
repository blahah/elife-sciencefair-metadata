Using a platform that combines exhaustive point-mutagenesis of peptide substrates, bacterial surface-display, cell sorting, and deep sequencing, we have defined the specificities of the first two kinases in this pathway, Lck and ZAP-70, for the T cell receptor Î¶ chain and the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76. We find that ZAP-70 selects its substrates by utilizing an electrostatic mechanism that excludes substrates with positively-charged residues and favors LAT and SLP-76 phosphosites that are surrounded by negatively-charged residues. This mechanism prevents ZAP-70 from phosphorylating its own activation loop, thereby enforcing its strict dependence on Lck for activation. The sequence features in ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP-76 that underlie electrostatic selectivity likely contribute to the specific response of T cells to foreign antigens.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20105"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20105"}],"date":{"day":"04","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20105","entryfile":"elife-20105-v4.xml","files":["elife-20105-app1-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-app1-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-app1-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-app1-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-app1-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig10-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig10-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig11-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig12-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig3-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig3-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig5-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig5-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig5-figsupp4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig5-figsupp5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-figsupp9-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig8-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig9-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig9-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-fig9-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20105-v1.xml","elife-20105-v2.xml","elife-20105-v3.xml"]}
