Some regulate their active counterparts but the structural principles of this regulation remain largely unknown. We report X-ray structures of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei S</italic>-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase alone and in functional complex with its catalytically dead paralogous partner, prozyme. We show monomeric <italic>Tb</italic>AdoMetDC is inactive because of autoinhibition by its N-terminal sequence. Heterodimerization with prozyme displaces this sequence from the active site through a complex mechanism involving a <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic> proline isomerization, reorganization of a β-sheet, and insertion of the N-terminal α-helix into the heterodimer interface, leading to enzyme activation. We propose that the evolution of this intricate regulatory mechanism was facilitated by the acquisition of the dimerization domain, a single step that can in principle account for the divergence of regulatory schemes in the AdoMetDC enzyme family. These studies elucidate an allosteric mechanism in an enzyme and a plausible scheme by which such complex cooperativity evolved.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20198"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20198"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20198","entryfile":"elife-20198-v2.xml","files":["elife-20198-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20198-v1.xml"]}
