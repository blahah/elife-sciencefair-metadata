{"title":"Sparse activity of identified dentate granule cells during spatial exploration","author":[{"surname":"Diamantaki","given-names":"Maria"},{"surname":"Frey","given-names":"Markus"},{"surname":"Berens","given-names":"Philipp"},{"surname":"Preston-Ferrer","given-names":"Patricia"},{"surname":"Burgalossi","given-names":"Andrea"}],"abstract":"In the dentate gyrus – a key component of spatial memory circuits – granule cells (GCs) are known to be morphologically diverse and to display heterogeneous activity profiles during behavior. To resolve structure–function relationships, we juxtacellularly recorded and labeled single GCs in freely moving rats. We found that the vast majority of neurons were silent during exploration. Most active GCs displayed a characteristic spike waveform, fired at low rates and showed spatial activity. Primary dendritic parameters were sufficient for classifying neurons as active or silent with high accuracy. Our data thus support a sparse coding scheme in the dentate gyrus and provide a possible link between structural and functional heterogeneity among the GC population.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20252"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20252"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20252","entryfile":"elife-20252-v4.xml","files":["elife-20252-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig1-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig4-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig4-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-resp-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-resp-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20252-resp-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20252-v1.xml","elife-20252-v2.xml","elife-20252-v3.xml"]}
