Here we show that CNS progenitors, referred to as radial glia, modulate vascular patterning around the spinal cord by acting as negative regulators. We found that radial glia ablation in zebrafish embryos leads to excessive sprouting of the trunk vessels around the spinal cord, and exclusively those of venous identity. Mechanistically, we determined that radial glia control this process via the Vegf decoy receptor sFlt1: <italic>sflt1</italic> mutants exhibit the venous over-sprouting observed in radial glia-ablated larvae, and sFlt1 overexpression rescues it. Genetic mosaic analyses show that sFlt1 function in trunk endothelial cells can limit their over-sprouting. Together, our findings identify CNS-resident progenitors as critical angiogenic regulators that determine the precise patterning of the vasculature around the spinal cord, providing novel insights into vascular network formation around developing organs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20253"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20253"}],"date":{"day":"17","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20253","entryfile":"elife-20253-v2.xml","files":["elife-20253-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20253-v1.xml"]}
