{"title":"Fatty acid analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine restores function of I<sub>Ks</sub> channels with diverse long QT mutations","author":[{"surname":"Liin","given-names":"Sara I"},{"surname":"Larsson","given-names":"Johan E"},{"surname":"Barro-Soria","given-names":"Rene"},{"surname":"Bentzen","given-names":"Bo Hjorth"},{"surname":"Larsson","given-names":"H Peter"}],"abstract":"About 300 loss-of-function mutations in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel have been identified in patients with Long QT syndrome and cardiac arrhythmia. How specific mutations cause arrhythmia is largely unknown and there are no approved I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators for treatment of these arrhythmias. We find that several Long QT syndrome-associated I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations shift channel voltage dependence and accelerate channel closing. Voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments and kinetic modeling suggest that similar mutation-induced alterations in I<sub>Ks</sub> channel currents may be caused by different molecular mechanisms. Finally, we find that the fatty acid analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine restores channel gating of many different mutant channels, even though the mutations are in different domains of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel and affect the channel by different molecular mechanisms. N-arachidonoyl taurine is therefore an interesting prototype compound that may inspire development of future I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators to treat Long QT syndrome caused by diverse I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20272"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20272"}],"date":{"day":"30","month":"09","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20272","entryfile":"elife-20272-v3.xml","files":["elife-20272-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20272-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20272-v1.xml","elife-20272-v2.xml"]}
