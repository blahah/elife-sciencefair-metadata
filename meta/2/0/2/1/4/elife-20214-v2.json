The gold-standard univariate method is based on collection of a 24-hr time series of plasma melatonin, a suprachiasmatic nucleus-driven pineal hormone. We developed and validated a multivariate whole-blood mRNA-based predictor of melatonin phase which requires few samples. Transcriptome data were collected under normal, sleep-deprivation and abnormal sleep-timing conditions to assess robustness of the predictor. Partial least square regression (PLSR), applied to the transcriptome, identified a set of 100 biomarkers primarily related to glucocorticoid signaling and immune function. Validation showed that PLSR-based predictors outperform published blood-derived circadian phase predictors. When given one sample as input, the R<sup>2</sup> of predicted vs observed phase was 0.74, whereas for two samples taken 12 hr apart, R<sup>2</sup> was 0.90. This blood transcriptome-based model enables assessment of circadian phase from a few samples.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20214"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20214"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20214","entryfile":"elife-20214-v2.xml","files":["elife-20214-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-resp-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20214-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20214-v1.xml"]}
