Here, we report the structure of the active form of human ORC determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The complex is composed of an ORC1/4/5 motor module lobe in an organization reminiscent of the DNA polymerase clamp loader complexes. A second lobe contains the ORC2/3 subunits. The complex is organized as a double-layered shallow corkscrew, with the AAA+ and AAA+-like domains forming one layer, and the winged-helix domains (WHDs) forming a top layer. CDC6 fits easily between ORC1 and ORC2, completing the ring and the DNA-binding channel, forming an additional ATP hydrolysis site. Analysis of the ATPase activity of the complex provides a basis for understanding ORC activity as well as molecular defects observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome mutations.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20818"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20818"}],"date":{"day":"23","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20818","entryfile":"elife-20818-v3.xml","files":["elife-20818-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-figsupp8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20818-v1.xml","elife-20818-v2.xml"]}
