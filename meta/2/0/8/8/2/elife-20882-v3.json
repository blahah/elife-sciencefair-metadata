{"title":"Constitutive scaffolding of multiple Wnt enhanceosome components by Legless/BCL9","author":[{"surname":"van Tienen","given-names":"Laurens M"},{"surname":"Mieszczanek","given-names":"Juliusz"},{"surname":"Fiedler","given-names":"Marc"},{"surname":"Rutherford","given-names":"Trevor J"},{"surname":"Bienz","given-names":"Mariann"}],"abstract":"Wnt/β-catenin signaling elicits context-dependent transcription switches that determine normal development and oncogenesis. These are mediated by the Wnt enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex binding to the Pygo chromatin reader and acting through TCF/LEF-responsive enhancers. Pygo renders this complex Wnt-responsive, by capturing β-catenin via the Legless/BCL9 adaptor. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of <italic>Drosophila legless (lgs)</italic> and human <italic>BCL9</italic> and <italic>B9L</italic> to show that the C-terminus downstream of their adaptor elements is crucial for Wnt responses. BioID proximity labeling revealed that BCL9 and B9L, like PYGO2, are constitutive components of the Wnt enhanceosome. Wnt-dependent docking of β-catenin to the enhanceosome apparently causes a rearrangement that apposes the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF. This C-terminus binds to the Groucho/TLE co-repressor, and also to the Chip/LDB1-SSDP enhanceosome core complex via an evolutionary conserved element. An unexpected link between BCL9/B9L, PYGO2 and nuclear co-receptor complexes suggests that these β-catenin co-factors may coordinate Wnt and nuclear hormone responses.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20882"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20882"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20882","entryfile":"elife-20882-v3.xml","files":["elife-20882-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig7-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20882-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20882-v1.xml","elife-20882-v2.xml"]}
