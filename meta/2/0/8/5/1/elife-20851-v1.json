Reasoning that this homeostatic challenge confronts all pulsatile organs, we developed a high resolution imaging and analysis toolset for measuring cardiac function in intact, unanesthetized <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We demonstrate that, as in humans, normal aging primarily manifests as defects in relaxation (diastole) while preserving contractile performance. Using this approach, we discovered that a pair of two-pore potassium channel (K2P) subunits, largely dispensable early in life, are necessary for terminating contraction (systole) in aged animals, where their loss culminates in fibrillatory cardiac arrest. As the pumping function of its heart is acutely dispensable for survival, <italic>Drosophila</italic> represents a uniquely accessible model for understanding the signaling networks maintaining cardiac performance during normal aging.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20851"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20851"}],"date":{"day":"22","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20851","entryfile":"elife-20851-v1.xml","files":["elife-20851-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig4-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig4-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-20851-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
