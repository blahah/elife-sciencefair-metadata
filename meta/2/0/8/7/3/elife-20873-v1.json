However, most human solid tumors have an abnormal karyotype implying that gain and loss of chromosomes by cancer cells confers a selective advantage. CIN can be induced in the mouse by inactivating the spindle assembly checkpoint. This is lethal in the germline but we show here that adult T cells and hepatocytes can survive conditional inactivation of the Mad2l1 SAC gene and resulting CIN. This causes rapid onset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and progressive development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), both lethal diseases. The resulting DNA copy number variation and patterns of chromosome loss and gain are tumor-type specific, suggesting differential selective pressures on the two tumor cell types.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20873"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20873"}],"date":{"day":"20","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20873","entryfile":"elife-20873-v1.xml","files":[]}
