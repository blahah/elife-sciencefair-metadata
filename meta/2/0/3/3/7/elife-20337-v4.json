Rodent-based studies show that activity-dependent transcriptional programs mediate myriad functions in neuronal development, but the extent of their conservation in human neurons is unknown. We compared activity-dependent transcriptional responses in developing human stem cell-derived cortical neurons with those induced in developing primary- or stem cell-derived mouse cortical neurons. While activity-dependent gene-responsiveness showed little dependence on developmental stage or origin (primary tissue vs. stem cell), notable species-dependent differences were observed. Moreover, differential species-specific gene ortholog regulation was recapitulated in aneuploid mouse neurons carrying human chromosome-21, implicating promoter/enhancer sequence divergence as a factor, including human-specific activity-responsive AP-1 sites. These findings support the use of human neuronal systems for probing transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli or indeed pharmaceutical agents.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20337"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20337"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"10","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20337","entryfile":"elife-20337-v4.xml","files":["elife-20337-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig1-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig3-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-20337-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-20337-v1.xml","elife-20337-v2.xml","elife-20337-v3.xml"]}
