Markers for distinguishing CRCs arising from ‘serrated’ versus ‘conventional adenoma’ precursors are lacking. We studied 36 human serrated CRCs and found CDX2 loss or <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations in ~60% of cases and often together (p<italic>=</italic>0.04). CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in adult mouse intestinal epithelium led to serrated morphology tumors (including carcinomas) and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> potently interacted with CDX2 silencing to alter gene expression. Like human serrated lesions, CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant epithelium expressed gastric markers. Organoids from CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>–mutant colon epithelium showed serrated features, and partially recapitulated the gene expression pattern in mouse colon tissues. We present a novel mouse tumor model based on signature defects seen in many human serrated CRCs – CDX2 loss and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. The mouse intestinal tumors show significant phenotypic similarities to human serrated CRCs and inform about serrated CRC pathogenesis.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20331"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20331"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20331","entryfile":"elife-20331-v2.xml","files":["elife-20331-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20331-v1.xml"]}
