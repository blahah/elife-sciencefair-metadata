{"title":"Transient protein-protein interactions perturb <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolome and cause gene dosage toxicity","author":[{"surname":"Bhattacharyya","given-names":"Sanchari"},{"surname":"Bershtein","given-names":"Shimon"},{"surname":"Yan","given-names":"Jin"},{"surname":"Argun","given-names":"Tijda"},{"surname":"Gilson","given-names":"Amy I"},{"surname":"Trauger","given-names":"Sunia A"},{"surname":"Shakhnovich","given-names":"Eugene I"}],"abstract":"Gene dosage toxicity (GDT) is an important factor that determines optimal levels of protein abundances, yet its molecular underpinnings remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of DHFR in <italic>E. coli</italic> causes a toxic metabolic imbalance triggered by interactions with several functionally related enzymes. Though deleterious in the overexpression regime, surprisingly, these interactions are beneficial at physiological concentrations, implying their functional significance <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, we found that overexpression of orthologous DHFR proteins had minimal effect on all levels of cellular organization – molecular, systems, and phenotypic, in sharp contrast to <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR. Dramatic difference of GDT between ‘<italic>E. coli</italic>’s self’ and ‘foreign’ proteins suggests the crucial role of evolutionary selection in shaping protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at the whole proteome level. This study shows how protein overexpression perturbs a dynamic metabolon of weak yet potentially functional PPI, with consequences for the metabolic state of cells and their fitness.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20309"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20309"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"12","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20309","entryfile":"elife-20309-v2.xml","files":["elife-20309-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig6-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig7-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig7-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20309-v1.xml"]}
