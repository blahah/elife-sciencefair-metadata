Among five known core centriole proteins, SPD-2/Cep192 is the first recruited to the site of daughter centriole formation and regulates the centriolar localization of the other components in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in humans. However, the molecular basis for SPD-2 centriolar localization remains unknown. Here, we describe a new centriole component, the coiled-coil protein SAS-7, as a regulator of centriole duplication, assembly and elongation. Intriguingly, our genetic data suggest that SAS-7 is required for daughter centrioles to become competent for duplication, and for mother centrioles to maintain this competence. We also show that SAS-7 binds SPD-2 and regulates SPD-2 centriolar recruitment, while SAS-7 centriolar localization is SPD-2-independent. Furthermore, pericentriolar material (PCM) formation is abnormal in <italic>sas-7</italic> mutants, and the PCM-dependent induction of cell polarity that defines the anterior-posterior body axis frequently fails. We conclude that SAS-7 functions at the earliest step in centriole duplication yet identified and plays important roles in the orchestration of centriole and PCM assembly.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20353"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20353"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20353","entryfile":"elife-20353-v2.xml","files":["elife-20353-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20353-v1.xml"]}
