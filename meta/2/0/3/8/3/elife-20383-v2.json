Among them, the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) is a crucial component of a ternary complex, including Reticulocyte binding-like Homologous protein 5 (PfRH5) and the RH5-interacting protein (PfRipr), essential for erythrocyte invasion. Here, we present the crystal structures of PfCyRPA and its complex with the antigen-binding fragment of a parasite growth inhibitory antibody. PfCyRPA adopts a 6-bladed Î²-propeller structure with similarity to the classic sialidase fold, but it has no sialidase activity and fulfills a purely non-enzymatic function. Characterization of the epitope recognized by protective antibodies may facilitate design of peptidomimetics to focus vaccine responses on protective epitopes. Both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own, supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in vaccines.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20383"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20383"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20383","entryfile":"elife-20383-v2.xml","files":["elife-20383-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-resp-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-resp-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-resp-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-resp-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20383-v1.xml"]}
