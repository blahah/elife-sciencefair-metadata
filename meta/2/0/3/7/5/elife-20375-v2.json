Although trophallaxis is widely considered a food-sharing mechanism, we hypothesized that endogenous components of this fluid might underlie a novel means of chemical communication between colony members. Through protein and small-molecule mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we found that trophallactic fluid in the ant <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> contains a set of specific digestion- and non-digestion related proteins, as well as hydrocarbons, microRNAs, and a key developmental regulator, juvenile hormone. When <italic>C. floridanus</italic> workers’ food was supplemented with this hormone, the larvae they reared via trophallaxis were twice as likely to complete metamorphosis and became larger workers. Comparison of trophallactic fluid proteins across social insect species revealed that many are regulators of growth, development and behavioral maturation. These results suggest that trophallaxis plays previously unsuspected roles in communication and enables communal control of colony phenotypes.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"20375"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.20375"}],"date":{"day":"29","month":"11","year":"2016"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"20375","entryfile":"elife-20375-v2.xml","files":["elife-20375-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-resp-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-20375-v1.xml"]}
