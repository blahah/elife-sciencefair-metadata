In most organisms, centromeres lack defined genetic features. Rather, they are specified epigenetically by a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A. The Mis18 complex, comprising the Mis18α:Mis18β subcomplex and M18BP1, is crucial for CENP-A homeostasis. It recruits the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres and primes it for CENP-A loading. We report here that a specific arrangement of Yippee domains in a human Mis18α:Mis18β 4:2 hexamer binds two copies of M18BP1 through M18BP1’s 140 N-terminal residues. Phosphorylation by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) at two conserved sites in this region destabilizes binding to Mis18α:Mis18β, limiting complex formation to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Using an improved viral 2A peptide co-expression strategy, we demonstrate that CDK1 controls Mis18 complex recruitment to centromeres by regulating oligomerization of M18BP1 through the Mis18α:Mis18β scaffold.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23352"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23352"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23352","entryfile":"elife-23352-v4.xml","files":["elife-23352-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig1-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig2-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig2-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig5-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig6-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig6-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig6-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig6-figsupp2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig7-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig7-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig8-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig8-figsupp1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23352-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23352-v1.xml","elife-23352-v2.xml","elife-23352-v3.xml"]}
