However, their role in GPCR-operated Erk1/2 activation differs between GPCRs and the underlying mechanism remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that activation of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, which engage Erk1/2 pathway via a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism, promotes MEK-dependent β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup>, a necessary step for Erk recruitment to the receptor/β-arrestin complex and Erk activation. Likewise, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation is involved in β-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 stimulation elicited by other GPCRs such as β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic, FSH and CXCR4 receptors, but does not affect the β-arrestin-independent Erk1/2 activation by 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor. Collectively, these data show that β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> underlies β-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 activation by GPCRs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23777"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23777"}],"date":{"day":"07","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23777","entryfile":"elife-23777-v2.xml","files":["elife-23777-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23777-v1.xml"]}
