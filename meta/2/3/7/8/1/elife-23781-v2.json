At the onset of this process, the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes depolarized and permeable to osmolytes, proposedly due to the opening of a non-selective protein channel of unknown molecular identity. A recent study purports that this channel, referred to as Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP), is formed within the c-subunit ring of the ATP synthase, upon its dissociation from the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Here, we examine this claim for two c-rings of different lumen width, through calculations of their ion conductance and selectivity based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We also quantify the likelihood that the lumen of these c-rings is in a hydrated, potentially conducting state rather than empty or blocked by lipid molecules. These calculations demonstrate that the structure and biophysical properties of a correctly assembled c-ring are inconsistent with those attributed to the MPTP.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23781"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23781"}],"date":{"day":"10","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","path":"23781","entryfile":"elife-23781-v2.xml","files":["elife-23781-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23781-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23781-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23781-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23781-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23781-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23781-v1.xml"]}
