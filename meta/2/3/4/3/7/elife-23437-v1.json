Here, we identify a novel role for a central region component of the SC, SYP-4, in negatively regulating formation of recombination-initiating double-strand breaks (DSBs) via a feedback loop triggered by crossover designation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that SYP-4 is phosphorylated dependent on Polo-like kinases PLK-1/2. SYP-4 phosphorylation depends on DSB formation and crossover designation, is required for stabilizing the SC in pachytene by switching the central region of the SC from a more dynamic to a less dynamic state, and negatively regulates DSB formation. We propose a model in which Polo-like kinases recognize crossover designation and phosphorylate SYP-4 thereby stabilizing the SC and making chromosomes less permissive for further DSB formation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23437"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23437"}],"date":{"day":"27","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23437","entryfile":"elife-23437-v1.xml","files":[]}
