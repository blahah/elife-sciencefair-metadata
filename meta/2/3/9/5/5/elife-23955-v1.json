Despite the existence of several high-resolution structures of pLGICs, their dynamical properties remain elusive. Using the proton-gated channel GLIC, we engineered multiple fluorescent reporters, each incorporating a bimane and a tryptophan/tyrosine, whose close distance causes fluorescence quenching. We show that proton application causes a global compaction of the extracellular subunit interface, coupled to an outward motion of the M2-M3 loop near the channel gate. These movements are highly similar in lipid vesicles and detergent micelles. These reorganizations are essentially completed within 2 ms and occur without channel opening at low proton concentration, indicating that they report a pre-active intermediate state in the transition pathway towards activation. This provides a template to investigate the gating of eukaryotic neurotransmitter receptors, for which intermediate states also participate in activation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23955"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23955"}],"date":{"day":"15","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23955","entryfile":"elife-23955-v1.xml","files":[]}
