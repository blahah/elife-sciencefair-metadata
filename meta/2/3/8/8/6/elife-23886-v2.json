{"title":"Crystal structure and dynamics of a lipid-induced potential desensitized-state of a pentameric ligand-gated channel","author":[{"surname":"Basak","given-names":"Sandip"},{"surname":"Schmandt","given-names":"Nicolaus"},{"surname":"Gicheru","given-names":"Yvonne"},{"surname":"Chakrapani","given-names":"Sudha"}],"abstract":"Desensitization in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels plays an important role in regulating neuronal excitability. Here, we show that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a key ω−3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in synaptic membranes, enhances the agonist-induced transition to the desensitized state in the prokaryotic channel GLIC. We determined a 3.25 Å crystal structure of the GLIC-DHA complex in a potentially desensitized conformation. The DHA molecule is bound at the channel-periphery near the M4 helix and exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore across domain-interfaces. In this previously unobserved conformation, the extracellular-half of the pore-lining M2 is splayed open, reminiscent of the open conformation, while the intracellular-half is constricted, leading to a loss of both water and permeant ions. These findings, in combination with spin-labeling/EPR spectroscopic measurements in reconstituted-membranes, provide novel mechanistic details of desensitization in pentameric channels.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23886"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23886"}],"date":{"day":"6","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23886","entryfile":"elife-23886-v2.xml","files":["elife-23886-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig3-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig3-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig4-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig4-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig4-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig5-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig5-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23886-v1.xml"]}
