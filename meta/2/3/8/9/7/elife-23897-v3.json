However, how autophagy contributes to plant immunity is unknown. Here we reported that the plant autophagic machinery targets the virulence factor βC1 of <italic>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</italic> (CLCuMuV) for degradation through its interaction with the key autophagy protein ATG8. A V32A mutation in βC1 abolished its interaction with NbATG8f, and virus carrying βC1<sup>V32A</sup> showed increased symptoms and viral DNA accumulation in plants. Furthermore, silencing of autophagy-related genes <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG7</italic> reduced plant resistance to the DNA viruses CLCuMuV, <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic>, and <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</italic>, whereas activating autophagy by silencing <italic>GAPC</italic> genes enhanced plant resistance to viral infection. Thus, autophagy represents a novel anti-pathogenic mechanism that plays an important role in antiviral immunity in plants.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23897"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23897"}],"date":{"day":"28","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23897","entryfile":"elife-23897-v3.xml","files":["elife-23897-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig3-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig3-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig3-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig3-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig5-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig5-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23897-v1.xml","elife-23897-v2.xml"]}
