Ambra1 regulates the targeting of active phospho-Src away from focal adhesions into autophagic structures that cancer cells use to survive adhesion stress. Ambra1 binds to both FAK and Src in cancer cells. When FAK is present, Ambra1 is recruited to focal adhesions, promoting FAK-regulated cancer cell direction-sensing and invasion. However, when Ambra1 cannot bind to FAK, abnormally high levels of phospho-Src and phospho-FAK accumulate at focal adhesions, positively regulating adhesion and invasive migration. Spatial control of active Src requires the trafficking proteins Dynactin one and IFITM3, which we identified as Ambra1 binding partners by interaction proteomics. We conclude that Ambra1 is a core component of an intracellular trafficking network linked to tight spatial control of active Src and FAK levels, and so crucially regulates their cancer-associated biological outputs.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23172"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23172"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23172","entryfile":"elife-23172-v1.xml","files":["elife-23172-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig2-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig4-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig5-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig5-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23172-resp-fig1-v1-600w.jpg"]}
