To get some insight into this question we ask how the connectivity patterns are organized at two successive synaptic relays in a simple, cholinergic efferent pathway. We found that the organization at successive relays in the parasympathetic nervous system strongly resemble each other despite the different embryological origin and physiological properties of the pre- and postsynaptic cells. Additionally, we found a similar developmental synaptic pruning and elaboration strategy is used at both sites to generate their adult organizations. The striking parallels in adult innervation and developmental mechanisms at the relays argue that a general strategy is in operation. We discuss why from a functional standpoint this structural organization may amplify central signals while at the same time maintaining positional targeting.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23193"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23193"}],"date":{"day":"03","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23193","entryfile":"elife-23193-v2.xml","files":["elife-23193-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23193-v1.xml"]}
