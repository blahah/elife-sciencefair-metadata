We used a genome-scale shRNA viability screen in human cancer cell lines to systematically identify genes that are essential in the context of particular copy-number alterations (copy-number associated gene dependencies). The most enriched class of copy-number associated gene dependencies was CYCLOPS (Copy-number alterations Yielding Cancer Liabilities Owing to Partial losS) genes, and spliceosome components were the most prevalent. One of these, the pre-mRNA splicing factor <italic>SF3B1</italic>, is also frequently mutated in cancer. We validated <italic>SF3B1</italic> as a CYCLOPS gene and found that human cancer cells harboring partial <italic>SF3B1</italic> copy-loss lack a reservoir of SF3b complex that protects cells with normal <italic>SF3B1</italic> copy number from cell death upon partial <italic>SF3B1</italic> suppression. These data provide a catalog of copy-number associated gene dependencies and identify partial copy-loss of wild-type <italic>SF3B1</italic> as a novel, non-driver cancer gene dependency.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23268"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23268"}],"date":{"day":"08","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23268","entryfile":"elife-23268-v2.xml","files":["elife-23268-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig3-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23268-v1.xml"]}
