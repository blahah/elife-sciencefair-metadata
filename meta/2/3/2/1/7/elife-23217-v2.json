Here we investigate the contribution of the rhoptry protein RhopH2, in the formation of new permeability pathways (NPPs) in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected erythrocytes. We show RhopH2 interacts with RhopH1, RhopH3, the erythrocyte cytoskeleton and exported proteins involved in host cell remodeling. Knockdown of RhopH2 expression in cycle one leads to a depletion of essential vitamins and cofactors and decreased de novo synthesis of pyrimidines in cycle two. There is also a significant impact on parasite growth, replication and transition into cycle three. The uptake of solutes that use NPPs to enter erythrocytes is also reduced upon RhopH2 knockdown. These findings provide direct genetic support for the contribution of the RhopH complex in NPP activity and highlight the importance of NPPs to parasite survival.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23217"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23217"}],"date":{"day":"02","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23217","entryfile":"elife-23217-v2.xml","files":["elife-23217-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig7-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23217-v1.xml"]}
