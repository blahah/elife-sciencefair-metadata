Commercial production of forskolin relies exclusively on extraction from its only known natural source, the plant<italic> Coleus forskohlii</italic>, in which forskolin accumulates in the root cork. Here we report the discovery of five cytochrome P450s and two acetyltransferases which catalyze a cascade of reactions converting the forskolin precursor 13<italic>R</italic>-manoyl oxide into forskolin and a diverse array of additional labdane-type diterpenoids. A minimal set of three P450s in combination with a single acetyl transferase was identified that catalyzes the conversion of 13<italic>R</italic>-manoyl oxide into forskolin as demonstrated by transient expression in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. The entire pathway for forskolin production from glucose encompassing expression of nine genes was stably integrated into <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>and afforded forskolin titers of 40 mg/L.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23001"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23001"}],"date":{"day":"14","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23001","entryfile":"elife-23001-v3.xml","files":["elife-23001-v1.xml","elife-23001-v2.xml"]}
