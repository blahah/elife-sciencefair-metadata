{"title":"Using the Volta phase plate with defocus for cryo-EM single particle analysis","author":[{"surname":"Danev","given-names":"Radostin"},{"surname":"Tegunov","given-names":"Dimitry"},{"surname":"Baumeister","given-names":"Wolfgang"}],"abstract":"Previously, we reported an in-focus data acquisition method for cryo-EM single-particle analysis with the Volta phase plate (Danev and Baumeister, 2016). Here, we extend the technique to include a small amount of defocus which enables contrast transfer function measurement and correction. This hybrid approach simplifies the experiment and increases the data acquisition speed. It also removes the resolution limit inherent to the in-focus method thus allowing 3D reconstructions with resolutions better than 3 Ã….","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23006"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23006"}],"date":{"day":"21","month":"01","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23006","entryfile":"elife-23006-v2.xml","files":["elife-23006-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23006-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23006-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23006-v1.xml"]}
