The majority seem healthy, but a higher frequency of defects has been reported among ART-conceived infants, suggesting an epigenetic cost. We report the first whole-genome DNA methylation datasets from single pig blastocysts showing differences between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos. Blastocysts were produced in vitro either without (C-IVF) or in the presence of natural reproductive fluids (Natur-IVF). Natur-IVF embryos were of higher quality than C-IVF in terms of cell number and hatching ability. RNA-Seq and DNA methylation analyses showed that Natur-IVF embryos have expression and methylation patterns closer to in vivo blastocysts. Genes involved in reprogramming, imprinting and development were affected by culture, with fewer aberrations in Natur-IVF embryos. Methylation analysis detected methylated changes in C-IVF, but not in Natur-IVF, at genes whose methylation could be critical, such as IGF2R and NNAT.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23670"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23670"}],"date":{"day":"01","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23670","entryfile":"elife-23670-v4.xml","files":["elife-23670-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig2-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig3-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig4-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig5-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig6-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig6-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig7-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig7-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig8-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-fig8-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-resp-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23670-resp-fig1-v4-600w.jpg","elife-23670-v1.xml","elife-23670-v2.xml","elife-23670-v3.xml"]}
