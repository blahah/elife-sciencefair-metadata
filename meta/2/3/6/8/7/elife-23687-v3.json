We report two 3.2 Å resolution cryo-EM structures – determined from a single sample – of the 70S ribosome with ArfA•RF2 in the A site. In both states, the ArfA C-terminus occupies the mRNA tunnel downstream of the A site. One state contains a compact inactive RF2 conformation. Ordering of the ArfA N-terminus in the second state rearranges RF2 into an extended conformation that docks the catalytic GGQ motif into the peptidyl-transferase center. Our work thus reveals the structural dynamics of ribosome rescue. The structures demonstrate how ArfA ‘senses’ the vacant mRNA tunnel and activates RF2 to mediate peptide release without a stop codon, allowing stalled ribosomes to be recycled.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23687"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23687"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23687","entryfile":"elife-23687-v3.xml","files":["elife-23687-fig1-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-figsupp5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-figsupp1-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-figsupp2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-figsupp2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-figsupp3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-figsupp3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig2-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig3-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig4-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23687-fig5-v3-600w.jpg","elife-23687-v1.xml","elife-23687-v2.xml"]}
