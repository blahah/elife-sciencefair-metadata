Immune receptor levels are intricately controlled by RNA processing and post-translational modification events, such as ubiquitination. It remains unknown whether, and if yes, how, plant immune receptor homeostasis is regulated at the translational level. From a <italic>mutant</italic>, <italic>snc1-enhancing </italic>(<italic>muse</italic>) forward genetic screen, we identified MUSE11/EXA1, which negatively regulates nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor mediated defence. EXA1 contains an evolutionarily conserved glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain that binds proline-rich sequences. Genetic and biochemical analysis revealed that loss of <italic>EXA1</italic> leads to heightened NLR accumulation and enhanced resistance against virulent pathogens. EXA1 also associates with eIF4E initiation factors and the ribosome complex, likely contributing to the proper translation of target proteins. In summary, our study reveals a previously unknown mechanism of regulating NLR homeostasis through translational repression by a GYF protein.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23684"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23684"}],"date":{"day":"31","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23684","entryfile":"elife-23684-v1.xml","files":[]}
