Here, we identified a small molecule that inhibits human pre-mRNA splicing at an intermediate stage during conversion of pre-catalytic spliceosomal B complexes into activated B<sup>act</sup> complexes. Characterization of the stalled complexes (designated B<sup>028</sup>) revealed that U4/U6 snRNP proteins are released during activation before the U6 Lsm and B-specific proteins, and before recruitment and/or stable incorporation of Prp19/CDC5L complex and other B<sup>act</sup> complex proteins. The U2/U6 RNA network in B<sup>028</sup> complexes differs from that of the B<sup>act</sup> complex, consistent with the idea that the catalytic RNA core forms stepwise during the B to B<sup>act</sup> transition and is likely stabilized by the Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the RNP rearrangements and extensive exchange of proteins that occurs during spliceosome activation.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23533"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23533"}],"date":{"day":"16","month":"03","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23533","entryfile":"elife-23533-v1.xml","files":["elife-23533-fig1-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig1-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig1-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig10-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig11-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig12-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig13-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig14-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig15-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig16-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig17-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig18-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig19-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig20-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig21-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig22-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig23-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig3-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig3-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig3-figsupp3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig3-figsupp4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig3-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig4-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig5-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig6-figsupp1-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig6-figsupp2-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig6-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig7-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig8-v1-600w.jpg","elife-23533-fig9-v1-600w.jpg"]}
