{"title":"When complex neuronal structures may not matter","author":[{"surname":"Otopalik","given-names":"Adriane G"},{"surname":"Sutton","given-names":"Alexander C"},{"surname":"Banghart","given-names":"Matthew"},{"surname":"Marder","given-names":"Eve"}],"abstract":"Much work has explored animal-to-animal variability and compensation in ion channel expression. Yet, little is known regarding the physiological consequences of morphological variability. We quantify animal-to-animal variability in cable lengths (CV = 0.4) and branching patterns in the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron, an identified neuron type with highly-conserved physiological properties in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of <italic>Cancer borealis.</italic> We examined passive GM electrotonic structure by measuring the amplitudes and apparent reversal potentials (E<sub>rev</sub>s) of inhibitory responses evoked with focal glutamate photo-uncaging in the presence of TTX. Apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were relatively invariant across sites (mean CV ± SD = 0.04 ± 0.01; 7–20 sites in each of 10 neurons), which ranged between 100–800 µm from the somatic recording site. Thus, GM neurons are remarkably electrotonically compact (estimated λ > 1.5 mm). Electrotonically compact structures, in consort with graded transmission, provide an elegant solution to observed morphological variability in the STG.","identifier":[{"type":"publisher-id","id":"23508"},{"type":"doi","id":"10.7554/eLife.23508"}],"date":{"day":"06","month":"02","year":"2017"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","path":"23508","entryfile":"elife-23508-v2.xml","files":["elife-23508-fig1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig10-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig11-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig2-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig3-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig4-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig4-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig5-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig5-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig6-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig6-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig7-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig8-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig8-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig9-figsupp1-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-fig9-v2-600w.jpg","elife-23508-v1.xml"]}
